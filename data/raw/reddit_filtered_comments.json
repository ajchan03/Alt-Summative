        "body": "For those confused what the crime here was, I wrote this:\n\nIt's important to note here, that paying hush money is not illegal.  Paying hush money to bury a story is not illegal.  Paying hush money for the purposes of a political campaign is not illegal.\n\nPaying hush money for the purposes of a political campaign and failing to report it to the Federal Election Commission, when the political campaign is for President of the United States *is* illegal.\n\nFalsifying business records to hide the purpose of that money and evade the mandatory reporting to the FEC is a crime in the state of New York.  \n\nThe issue is more subtle.  It's not that he paid hush money, it's that he doctored, and instructed others to doctor, business records in New York State to hide the (totally legal) use of funds in order to conceal the actual purpose of paying those funds, in order to evade the requirement that he report those funds to the FEC.  \n\nIt would have been totally legal for Trump to have paid Daniels for her story, and paid her not to talk about it in the press.  And if he did those purely for personal reasons (like to save his family the embarrassment) he wouldn't have really needed to disclose them to anyone.  But if he paid those funds to increase his odds of winning the Presidential election he was legally mandated to report those funds to the FEC.  The jury found, based on the evidence presented, that those funds were paid to increase his chances to win the presidental election, not for any personal reasons.  They likewise found he failed to report the payment of those funds to the FEC, which is a crime, but it's a federal crime and not one the State of New York has jurisdiction over.  \n\nThe jury further found that he doctored business records in order to conceal the fact that he committed a crime by failing to report the spending of campaign-related funds to the FEC.  Doctoring business records to conceal a crime is, in and of itself, a crime in the State of New York.  That's what he's convicted for.\n\nEssentially the jury found:\n\n* 1)  Trump paid, and directed others to pay certain funds used to induce people to to either purchase rights to stories in order to bury them, or to not disclose what they saw or knew (this is legal)\n* 2)  The purpose of those funds was to prevent unfavorable news stories from reaching the public eye (also legal)\n* 3)  The purpose of attempting to prevent those unfavorable news stories from reaching the public eye was to influence the 2016 Presidential Election (ALSO legal)\n* 4)  Trump failed to disclose the spending of those funds, spent with the intent of influencing the 2016 Presidential Election to the Federal Election Commission (illegal, but that's a federal crime, and one the state of New York has no jurisdiction to prosecute over)\n* 5)  Trump doctored, or directed others to doctor, business records of his New York based business to hide the true purpose of those funds (this is a misdemeanor in the state of new york)\n* 6)  The purpose behind doctoring those records was to conceal the fact that Trump committed a crime by failing to report the payment of those funds to the FEC (the failure to do so is a federal crime)\n* 7)  Doctoring business records in NY for the purposes of concealing a crime (any crime, state or federal) elevates the misdemeanor to a felony\n* 8)  Trump did this 34 times.",

Are official acts anything that falls within the constitutional powers of the president, or is it anything the president has given direct mandates to have done? Can actions to reverse an election be considered official acts if Trump directly ordered them? Would the retention of classified documents be considered official and done during his presidency, or are they considered outside the time period because the crime itself is retaining documents AFTER leaving office, specifically obstruction of justice for not returning them?\n\nAlso, to my knowledge this does not provide protection for any federal crimes committed after office, and of course has no impact on state crimes as they directly specify \u201cfederal prosecution\u201d.",

And, that is so despite numerous past Presidents taking actions that many would argue constitute crimes.\"\n\n\n\"If this unprecedented prosecution is to proceed, it must be conducted by someone duly authorized to do so by the American people. The lower courts should thus answer these essential questions concerning the special counsel's appointment before proceeding,\" Thomas added.\n\n\nThomas explained that he was writing a separate opinion, in support of the majority, to highlight that Smith may have been illegally appointed.\n\n\n\n\"Few things would threaten our constitutional order more than criminally prosecuting a former President for his official acts. Fortunately, the Constitution does not permit us to chart such a dangerous course,\" he wrote, before focusing on Smith's appointment.\n\n\n\"I write separately to highlight another way in which this prosecution may violate our constitutional structure. In this case, the Attorney General purported to appoint a private citizen as Special Counsel to prosecute a former President on behalf of the United States. But, I am not sure that any office for the Special Counsel has been 'established by law,\" as the Constitution requires,\" Thomas wrote.\n\n\nIn an opinion that mirrors Trump's legal argument in his election interference case in Washington, D.C., and his classified documents hoarding case in Florida, Thomas suggested that Smith may have been unlawfully appointed.\"",

Enormous kudos to Judge Merchan, Alvin Bragg, and most of all to the jury for issuing what will stand as one of the most consequential verdicts in American history.\n\nDespite what you'll see a lot of non-lawyers claim, I expect to see Trump to do some time for this. He isn't an average defendant, this isn't an average crime, and Judge Merchan has a truly historic opportunity to realize an oft-spoken but less frequently realized aspiration of the justice system: no-one is above the law. Putting Trump away for even a few months will set an example for decades or centuries to come.\n\nWhat comes next is this: Trump is going to lose the 2024 election. He was on shaky ground before this verdict and his chances won't survive the label of 'convicted felon.' Soon, mercifully, Donald Trump won't be our problem. \n\nBut we aren't free of problems. We will need to reckon - and it will be *difficult* - with the reality that even as a felon, Trump will win many states and pull many tens of millions of votes. Those voters are our problem. They live outside of reality, willfully locked in a bubble of resentment and commercialized fear-mongering, and they will find another Donald Trump. Until as a country we're able to heal our polity, to bring these voters back to something that approximates reality, the danger hasn't passed.",

BIDEN, JR.\n\nJuly 21, 2024\n\nMy Fellow Americans,\n\nOver the past three and a half years, we have made great progress as a Nation.\n\nToday, America has the strongest economy in the world. We\u2019ve made historic investments in rebuilding our Nation, in lowering prescription drug costs for seniors, and in expanding affordable health care to a record number of Americans. We\u2019ve provided critically needed care to a million veterans exposed to toxic substances. Passed the first gun safety law in 30 years. Appointed the first African American woman to the Supreme Court. And passed the most significant climate legislation in the history of the world. America has never been better positioned to lead than we are today.\n\nI know none of this could have been done without you, the American people. Together, we overcame a once in a century pandemic and the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. We\u2019ve protected and preserved our Democracy. And we\u2019ve revitalized and strengthened our alliances around the world.\n\nIt has been the greatest honor of my life to serve as your President. And while it has been my intention to seek reelection, I believe it is in the best interest of my party and the country for me to stand down and to focus solely on fulfilling my duties as President for the remainder of my term.\n\nI will speak to the Nation later this week in more detail about my decision.\n\nFor now, let me express my deepest gratitude to all those who have worked so hard to see me reelected. I want to thank Vice President Kamala Harris for being an extraordinary partner in all this work. And let me express my heartfelt appreciation to the American people for the faith and trust you have placed in me.\n\nI believe today what I always have: that there is nothing America can\u2019t do \u2013 when we do it together. We just have to remember we are the United States of America.\n\n(Signature)",

On remand, the District Court must carefully analyze the indictment\u2019s remaining allegations to determine whether they too involve conduct for which a President must be immune from prosecution.

So, for example, if Trump had personally attempted to shoot and kill then-presidential candidate Joe Biden in the lead-up to the 2020 election, rather than ordering a subordinate to do so, then Trump could probably be prosecuted for murder.\n\n>But even this caveat to Roberts\u2019s sweeping immunity decision is not very strong. Roberts writes that \u201cin dividing official from unofficial conduct, courts may not inquire into the President\u2019s motives.\u201d And Roberts even limits the ability of prosecutors to pursue a president who accepts a bribe in return for committing an official act, such as pardoning a criminal who pays off the president. In Roberts\u2019s words, a prosecutor may not \u201cadmit testimony or private records of the President or his advisers probing the official act itself.\u201d\n\n>That means that, [while the president can be prosecuted for an \u201cunofficial\u201d act, the prosecutors may not prove that he committed this crime using evidence drawn from the president\u2019s \u201cofficial\u201d actions.](https://www.vox.com/scotus/358292/supreme-court-trump-immunity-dictatorship)\n\n>The practical implications of this ruling are astounding. As Justice Sonia Sotomayor writes in a dissenting opinion, \u201cimagine a President states in an official speech that he intends to stop a political rival from passing legislation that he opposes, no matter what it takes to do so,\u201d it follows from Roberts\u2019s opinion that the ensuing murder indictment \u201ccould include no allegation of the President\u2019s public admission of premeditated intent to support\u201d the proposition that the president intended to commit murder.",

BIDEN, JR.\n\nJuly 21, 2024\n\nMy Fellow Americans,\n\nOver the past three and a half years, we have made great progress as a Nation.\n\nToday, America has the strongest economy in the world. We\u2019ve made historic investments in rebuilding our Nation, in lowering prescription drug costs for seniors, and in expanding affordable health care to a record number of Americans. We\u2019ve provided critically needed care to a million veterans exposed to toxic substances. Passed the first gun safety law in 30 years. Appointed the first African American woman to the Supreme Court. And passed the most significant climate legislation in the history of the world. America has never been better positioned to lead than we are today.\n\nI know none of this could have been done without you, the American people. Together, we overcame a once in a century pandemic and the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. We\u2019ve protected and preserved our Democracy. And we\u2019ve revitalized and strengthened our alliances around the world.\n\nIt has been the greatest honor of my life to serve as your President. And while it has been my intention to seek reelection, I believe it is in the best interest of my party and the country for me to stand down and to focus solely on fulfilling my duties as President for the remainder of my term.\n\nI will speak to the Nation later this week in more detail about my decision.\n\nFor now, let me express my deepest gratitude to all those who have worked so hard to see me reelected. I want to thank Vice President Kamala Harris for being an extraordinary partner in all this work. And let me express my heartfelt appreciation to the American people for the faith and trust you have placed in me.\n\nI believe today what I always have: that there is nothing America can\u2019t do \u2013 when we do it together. We just have to remember we are the United States of America.\n\n(Signature)",

It was already the case that charges and trials could not be brought while a president is in office. Importantly, this extends that protection to after a president leaves office, but only covers official acts during his presidency.\n\nThe major question now is, what constitutes official vs unofficial acts? Are official acts anything that falls within the constitutional powers of the president, or is it anything the president has given direct mandates to have done? Can actions to reverse an election be considered official acts if Trump directly ordered them? Would the retention of classified documents be considered official and done during his presidency, or are they considered outside the time period because the crime itself is retaining documents AFTER leaving office, specifically obstruction of justice for not returning them?\n\nAlso, to my knowledge this does not provide protection for any federal crimes committed after office, and of course has no impact on state crimes as they directly specify \u201cfederal prosecution\u201d.",

Paying hush money for the purposes of a political campaign is not illegal.\n\nPaying hush money for the purposes of a political campaign and failing to report it to the Federal Election Commission, when the political campaign is for President of the United States *is* illegal.\n\nFalsifying business records to hide the purpose of that money and evade the mandatory reporting to the FEC is a crime in the state of New York.  \n\nThe issue is more subtle.  It's not that he paid hush money, it's that he doctored, and instructed others to doctor, business records in New York State to hide the (totally legal) use of funds in order to conceal the actual purpose of paying those funds, in order to evade the requirement that he report those funds to the FEC.  \n\nIt would have been totally legal for Trump to have paid Daniels for her story, and paid her not to talk about it in the press.  And if he did those purely for personal reasons (like to save his family the embarrassment) he wouldn't have really needed to disclose them to anyone.  But if he paid those funds to increase his odds of winning the Presidential election he was legally mandated to report those funds to the FEC.  The jury found, based on the evidence presented, that those funds were paid to increase his chances to win the presidental election, not for any personal reasons.  They likewise found he failed to report the payment of those funds to the FEC, which is a crime, but it's a federal crime and not one the State of New York has jurisdiction over.  \n\nThe jury further found that he doctored business records in order to conceal the fact that he committed a crime by failing to report the spending of campaign-related funds to the FEC.  Doctoring business records to conceal a crime is, in and of itself, a crime in the State of New York.  That's what he's convicted for.\n\nEssentially the jury found:\n\n* 1)  Trump paid, and directed others to pay certain funds used to induce people to to either purchase rights to stories in order to bury them, or to not disclose what they saw or knew (this is legal)\n* 2)  The purpose of those funds was to prevent unfavorable news stories from reaching the public eye (also legal)\n* 3)  The purpose of attempting to prevent those unfavorable news stories from reaching the public eye was to influence the 2016 Presidential Election (ALSO legal)\n* 4)  Trump failed to disclose the spending of those funds, spent with the intent of influencing the 2016 Presidential Election to the Federal Election Commission (illegal, but that's a federal crime, and one the state of New York has no jurisdiction to prosecute over)\n* 5)  Trump doctored, or directed others to doctor, business records of his New York based business to hide the true purpose of those funds (this is a misdemeanor in the state of new york)\n* 6)  The purpose behind doctoring those records was to conceal the fact that Trump committed a crime by failing to report the payment of those funds to the FEC (the failure to do so is a federal crime)\n* 7)  Doctoring business records in NY for the purposes of concealing a crime (any crime, state or federal) elevates the misdemeanor to a felony\n* 8)  Trump did this 34 times.",

I would normally just get highlights and this whole thing was actually entertaining enough to hold my attention all 4 days. I personally think she nailed that speech. However, I think the Palestinian protestors probably hated it just for her pointing out that Israel has a right to defend itself. I am sorry, but if you don't vote for her in protest because of that then you're actively working against your own interests. Your interests in your own well being in this country and in the interests of those people you're trying to get help for because only one side here is calling for a ceasefire. Maybe it's not as strong of wording or even action as you want, but it's the best you're going to get and a lot better than the alternative.",

Paying hush money for the purposes of a political campaign is not illegal.\n\nPaying hush money for the purposes of a political campaign and failing to report it to the Federal Election Commission, when the political campaign is for President of the United States *is* illegal.\n\nFalsifying business records to hide the purpose of that money and evade the mandatory reporting to the FEC is a crime in the state of New York.  \n\nThe issue is more subtle.  It's not that he paid hush money, it's that he doctored, and instructed others to doctor, business records in New York State to hide the (totally legal) use of funds in order to conceal the actual purpose of paying those funds, in order to evade the requirement that he report those funds to the FEC.  \n\nIt would have been totally legal for Trump to have paid Daniels for her story, and paid her not to talk about it in the press.  And if he did those purely for personal reasons (like to save his family the embarrassment) he wouldn't have really needed to disclose them to anyone.  But if he paid those funds to increase his odds of winning the Presidential election he was legally mandated to report those funds to the FEC.  The jury found, based on the evidence presented, that those funds were paid to increase his chances to win the presidental election, not for any personal reasons.  They likewise found he failed to report the payment of those funds to the FEC, which is a crime, but it's a federal crime and not one the State of New York has jurisdiction over.  \n\nThe jury further found that he doctored business records in order to conceal the fact that he committed a crime by failing to report the spending of campaign-related funds to the FEC.  Doctoring business records to conceal a crime is, in and of itself, a crime in the State of New York.  That's what he's convicted for.\n\nEssentially the jury found:\n\n* 1)  Trump paid, and directed others to pay certain funds used to induce people to to either purchase rights to stories in order to bury them, or to not disclose what they saw or knew (this is legal)\n* 2)  The purpose of those funds was to prevent unfavorable news stories from reaching the public eye (also legal)\n* 3)  The purpose of attempting to prevent those unfavorable news stories from reaching the public eye was to influence the 2016 Presidential Election (ALSO legal)\n* 4)  Trump failed to disclose the spending of those funds, spent with the intent of influencing the 2016 Presidential Election to the Federal Election Commission (illegal, but that's a federal crime, and one the state of New York has no jurisdiction to prosecute over)\n* 5)  Trump doctored, or directed others to doctor, business records of his New York based business to hide the true purpose of those funds (this is a misdemeanor in the state of new york)\n* 6)  The purpose behind doctoring those records was to conceal the fact that Trump committed a crime by failing to report the payment of those funds to the FEC (the failure to do so is a federal crime)\n* 7)  Doctoring business records in NY for the purposes of concealing a crime (any crime, state or federal) elevates the misdemeanor to a felony\n* 8)  Trump did this 34 times.",

Feel free to (please) steal this and put it somewhere more visible. It's just an AI transcription.\n\n---\n\nJOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR.\n\nJuly 21, 2024\n\nMy Fellow Americans,\n\nOver the past three and a half years, we have made great progress as a Nation.\n\nToday, America has the strongest economy in the world. We\u2019ve made historic investments in rebuilding our Nation, in lowering prescription drug costs for seniors, and in expanding affordable health care to a record number of Americans. We\u2019ve provided critically needed care to a million veterans exposed to toxic substances. Passed the first gun safety law in 30 years. Appointed the first African American woman to the Supreme Court. And passed the most significant climate legislation in the history of the world. America has never been better positioned to lead than we are today.\n\nI know none of this could have been done without you, the American people. Together, we overcame a once in a century pandemic and the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. We\u2019ve protected and preserved our Democracy. And we\u2019ve revitalized and strengthened our alliances around the world.\n\nIt has been the greatest honor of my life to serve as your President. And while it has been my intention to seek reelection, I believe it is in the best interest of my party and the country for me to stand down and to focus solely on fulfilling my duties as President for the remainder of my term.\n\nI will speak to the Nation later this week in more detail about my decision.\n\nFor now, let me express my deepest gratitude to all those who have worked so hard to see me reelected. I want to thank Vice President Kamala Harris for being an extraordinary partner in all this work. And let me express my heartfelt appreciation to the American people for the faith and trust you have placed in me.\n\nI believe today what I always have: that there is nothing America can\u2019t do \u2013 when we do it together. We just have to remember we are the United States of America.\n\n(Signature)",

Paying hush money for the purposes of a political campaign is not illegal.\n\nPaying hush money for the purposes of a political campaign and failing to report it to the Federal Election Commission, when the political campaign is for President of the United States *is* illegal.\n\nFalsifying business records to hide the purpose of that money and evade the mandatory reporting to the FEC is a crime in the state of New York.  \n\nThe issue is more subtle.  It's not that he paid hush money, it's that he doctored, and instructed others to doctor, business records in New York State to hide the (totally legal) use of funds in order to conceal the actual purpose of paying those funds, in order to evade the requirement that he report those funds to the FEC.  \n\nIt would have been totally legal for Trump to have paid Daniels for her story, and paid her not to talk about it in the press.  And if he did those purely for personal reasons (like to save his family the embarrassment) he wouldn't have really needed to disclose them to anyone.  But if he paid those funds to increase his odds of winning the Presidential election he was legally mandated to report those funds to the FEC.  The jury found, based on the evidence presented, that those funds were paid to increase his chances to win the presidental election, not for any personal reasons.  They likewise found he failed to report the payment of those funds to the FEC, which is a crime, but it's a federal crime and not one the State of New York has jurisdiction over.  \n\nThe jury further found that he doctored business records in order to conceal the fact that he committed a crime by failing to report the spending of campaign-related funds to the FEC.  Doctoring business records to conceal a crime is, in and of itself, a crime in the State of New York.  That's what he's convicted for.\n\nEssentially the jury found:\n\n* 1)  Trump paid, and directed others to pay certain funds used to induce people to to either purchase rights to stories in order to bury them, or to not disclose what they saw or knew (this is legal)\n* 2)  The purpose of those funds was to prevent unfavorable news stories from reaching the public eye (also legal)\n* 3)  The purpose of attempting to prevent those unfavorable news stories from reaching the public eye was to influence the 2016 Presidential Election (ALSO legal)\n* 4)  Trump failed to disclose the spending of those funds, spent with the intent of influencing the 2016 Presidential Election to the Federal Election Commission (illegal, but that's a federal crime, and one the state of New York has no jurisdiction to prosecute over)\n* 5)  Trump doctored, or directed others to doctor, business records of his New York based business to hide the true purpose of those funds (this is a misdemeanor in the state of new york)\n* 6)  The purpose behind doctoring those records was to conceal the fact that Trump committed a crime by failing to report the payment of those funds to the FEC (the failure to do so is a federal crime)\n* 7)  Doctoring business records in NY for the purposes of concealing a crime (any crime, state or federal) elevates the misdemeanor to a felony\n* 8)  Trump did this 34 times.",

BIDEN, JR.\n\nJuly 21, 2024\n\nMy Fellow Americans,\n\nOver the past three and a half years, we have made great progress as a Nation.\n\nToday, America has the strongest economy in the world. We\u2019ve made historic investments in rebuilding our Nation, in lowering prescription drug costs for seniors, and in expanding affordable health care to a record number of Americans. We\u2019ve provided critically needed care to a million veterans exposed to toxic substances. Passed the first gun safety law in 30 years. Appointed the first African American woman to the Supreme Court. And passed the most significant climate legislation in the history of the world. America has never been better positioned to lead than we are today.\n\nI know none of this could have been done without you, the American people. Together, we overcame a once in a century pandemic and the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. We\u2019ve protected and preserved our Democracy. And we\u2019ve revitalized and strengthened our alliances around the world.\n\nIt has been the greatest honor of my life to serve as your President. And while it has been my intention to seek reelection, I believe it is in the best interest of my party and the country for me to stand down and to focus solely on fulfilling my duties as President for the remainder of my term.\n\nI will speak to the Nation later this week in more detail about my decision.\n\nFor now, let me express my deepest gratitude to all those who have worked so hard to see me reelected. I want to thank Vice President Kamala Harris for being an extraordinary partner in all this work. And let me express my heartfelt appreciation to the American people for the faith and trust you have placed in me.\n\nI believe today what I always have: that there is nothing America can\u2019t do \u2013 when we do it together. We just have to remember we are the United States of America.\n\n(Signature)",

        "body": "One of the main issues I'm seeing with this ruling is that it's basically allowing a president to conspire with Executive Branch members as long as they dress it up as an official act.\n\n>The indictment\u2019s allegations that the requested investigations were shams or proposed for an improper purpose do not divest the President of exclusive authority over the investigative and prosecutorial functions of the Justice Department and its officials. Because the President cannot be prosecuted for conduct within his exclusive constitutional authority, Trump is absolutely immune from prosecution for the alleged conduct involving his discussions with Justice Department officials.\n\nAnd because of this line, they can't actually show how a president is abusing their authority as president for unofficial acts.\n\n>\"In dividing official from unofficial conduct, courts may not inquire into the President\u2019s motives.\"\n\nSo the fact that Trump lied about election fraud and conspired with DOJ officials to push this lie to remain in power is essentially meaningless because they hid it behind a gossamer veneer of a \"DOJ investigation behind election fraud claims\" that they made up and district courts cannot look at the motive behind it, which was violating the will of the people and the election laws of the states and federal government to illegally remain in power.",

If it still looks fake or like a false flag or whatever the fuck after that point, whatever. but for gods sake use some critical thinking to get there instead of jumping to conclusions with no info.\n\nFor what its worth, I am extremely anti-trump, I am scared shitless of what will happen should he win a second term. But dear god, please think about the way you all are acting, when you act like the same kind of psychopaths you claim to stand against it is not a good look. please consider that before you post.",

Fortunately, the Constitution does not permit us to chart such a dangerous course,\" he wrote, before focusing on Smith's appointment.\n\n\n\"I write separately to highlight another way in which this prosecution may violate our constitutional structure.

Paying hush money for the purposes of a political campaign is not illegal.\n\nPaying hush money for the purposes of a political campaign and failing to report it to the Federal Election Commission, when the political campaign is for President of the United States *is* illegal.\n\nFalsifying business records to hide the purpose of that money and evade the mandatory reporting to the FEC is a crime in the state of New York.  \n\nThe issue is more subtle.  It's not that he paid hush money, it's that he doctored, and instructed others to doctor, business records in New York State to hide the (totally legal) use of funds in order to conceal the actual purpose of paying those funds, in order to evade the requirement that he report those funds to the FEC.  \n\nIt would have been totally legal for Trump to have paid Daniels for her story, and paid her not to talk about it in the press.  And if he did those purely for personal reasons (like to save his family the embarrassment) he wouldn't have really needed to disclose them to anyone.  But if he paid those funds to increase his odds of winning the Presidential election he was legally mandated to report those funds to the FEC.  The jury found, based on the evidence presented, that those funds were paid to increase his chances to win the presidental election, not for any personal reasons.  They likewise found he failed to report the payment of those funds to the FEC, which is a crime, but it's a federal crime and not one the State of New York has jurisdiction over.  \n\nThe jury further found that he doctored business records in order to conceal the fact that he committed a crime by failing to report the spending of campaign-related funds to the FEC.  Doctoring business records to conceal a crime is, in and of itself, a crime in the State of New York.  That's what he's convicted for.\n\nEssentially the jury found:\n\n* 1)  Trump paid, and directed others to pay certain funds used to induce people to to either purchase rights to stories in order to bury them, or to not disclose what they saw or knew (this is legal)\n* 2)  The purpose of those funds was to prevent unfavorable news stories from reaching the public eye (also legal)\n* 3)  The purpose of attempting to prevent those unfavorable news stories from reaching the public eye was to influence the 2016 Presidential Election (ALSO legal)\n* 4)  Trump failed to disclose the spending of those funds, spent with the intent of influencing the 2016 Presidential Election to the Federal Election Commission (illegal, but that's a federal crime, and one the state of New York has no jurisdiction to prosecute over)\n* 5)  Trump doctored, or directed others to doctor, business records of his New York based business to hide the true purpose of those funds (this is a misdemeanor in the state of new york)\n* 6)  The purpose behind doctoring those records was to conceal the fact that Trump committed a crime by failing to report the payment of those funds to the FEC (the failure to do so is a federal crime)\n* 7)  Doctoring business records in NY for the purposes of concealing a crime (any crime, state or federal) elevates the misdemeanor to a felony\n* 8)  Trump did this 34 times.",

According to sources, Trump believes that \u201cbody language says more than words\u201d and has asked his staff to prepare updates using choreographed movements to illustrate crucial points. Allegedly, for a recent briefing on foreign threats, aides in costume performed a short routine where one staffer dressed as an \u201cenemy nation\u201d did exaggerated stomping and finger-wagging, while another\u2014embodying \u201cthe American economy\u201d\u2014leaped over obstacles and did triumphant fist pumps. Trump, reportedly delighted, has requested more \u201cdance briefings\u201d for future meetings, sparking an odd rush on dance consultants among his inner circle.",

Companies did merge with the state, the way it was done was essentially nationalization, with some autonomy granted by the party because when these industries were taken over, they were given to card carrying party members. The distinction between this and direct nationalization is incredibly thin. Hitler also created a massive union for workers.\n\nThe thing about Nazism and by extension Fascism, is that they are collectivist and totalitarian, and *expansionist*. Therefore, and the left hates hearing this, it\u2019s strongly on the left. There aren\u2019t many things that actually separate communism and fascism other than how they practically applied their regimes, and what their commune was. For Hitler it was the German race, for Stalin it was the working class, and for Mussolini it was the Italian people. They all favored totalitarian collectivism and were all aggressively expansionist. Communism, unlike Italy and Germany, still believed in an international revolution. Many people forget that even before Hitler and Mussolini became relevant the communists had formed Comintern that advocated for an international revolution (and was succeeded by Cominform).\n\nAdd to all of this that, as another commenter said, Hitler hated the Jews because he said that they were international capitalists. The reason that communists and the burgeoning Nazi part kept fighting in the lead up to Hitler becoming chancellor, was *not* because they were diametrically opposed in ideology. They disagreed on how to apply socialism (so example 1,304,678 of the left eating itself)\n\nSo you have 3 ideologies that are totalitarian, collectivist, and believed in aggressive expansion. This is far from what the right would be propping up. What frustrates me the most is that historians (I am guessing that they are somewhat lefty in their own right) defend the notion that fascism is on the \u201cright\u201d which logically just does not make any sense. Unless we are talking about strictly leftist forms of government where national socialism and Italian fascism are slightly to the right of that, then sure they are on the \u201cright\u201d.",

The former is racist in a nationalist way (i.e. if you live in the kingdom of italy, you are a part of the state. But everyone outside the state is inferior), while the latter was racist in a biological way (e.g. everyone who was not a nordic-germanic aryan with a 57cm skull circumference, is inferior). This means that co-governance would actually be impossible because the fascists would have to execute people whom they considered to be equal under the state but the nazis viewed as racial inferiors. The Jews are a good example of this. Hitler tried to persecute Italian Jews, but mussolini never really cooperated. Funny thing is there were 10,000 Jews in the fascist party of Italy. Oh and, would you believe me if I told you the philosophical founder of fascism (Giovanni Gentile) helped Jews escape from National Socialist custody? \n\nMussolini was staunchly opposed to Hitler's anschluss of austria, and he sent divisions into the mountains of northern Italy to deter Hitler. Also, there are tonnes of quotes by Mussolini, Hitler, and Goebbels where they talk down on each other's ideology. \n\nHitler thought that Mussolini's fascism was crap. Hitler also claimed to be \"a true socialist\". So there's that.\n\nIt was only when they were in the same sinking ship that they decided to team up (both were excluded from the league of nations, both were facing economic sanctions from the west). \n\nTLDR: I agree but I take it one step further: Nazism is not fascism, it is National SOCIALISM.

Planning to go vote early this week, all red ballot. \n\nIt does feel like Gen Z is a bit more red than we are and I\u2019m so glad to see it, although the left on Gen Z are SUPER left.

A lot of it is where I live (close to the dmv area and used to live in DC proper, before that NYC where I\u2019m originally from), but I barely knew any right leaning people.

I don\u2019t put stickers on my car or signs in my yard. Frankly I\u2019m not interested in lunatics vandalizing my stuff. I don\u2019t wear my (black) MAGA hat out often because I\u2019m not interested in some lunatic screaming in my baby\u2019s face as we have seen recently.

If Republicans will take away one aspect of control over a woman's body, they will take away other aspects of control over her body.\n\nA very easy way to counter this and begin to win back the female vote is for Republicans to push for states, particularly swing states, to put abortion up to a vote.\n\nShow them that we really do mean it's a state issue and that was our problem with Roe. Right now there are some states, like my own in Georgia, that have strict anti-abortion laws and voters are forced to choose between voting Democrat(even though abortion might be the only thing they agreed with them on) or voting Republican. If we just put abortion as a single issue on the ballot then we can finally put this issue behind us and it will stop dragging us down.",

According to sources, Trump believes that \u201cbody language says more than words\u201d and has asked his staff to prepare updates using choreographed movements to illustrate crucial points. Allegedly, for a recent briefing on foreign threats, aides in costume performed a short routine where one staffer dressed as an \u201cenemy nation\u201d did exaggerated stomping and finger-wagging, while another\u2014embodying \u201cthe American economy\u201d\u2014leaped over obstacles and did triumphant fist pumps. Trump, reportedly delighted, has requested more \u201cdance briefings\u201d for future meetings, sparking an odd rush on dance consultants among his inner circle.",

I still 100% believe there was significant fraud in 2020.
