He isn't an average defendant, this isn't an average crime, and Judge Merchan has a truly historic opportunity to realize an oft-spoken but less frequently realized aspiration of the justice system: no-one is above the law. Putting Trump away for even a few months will set an example for decades or centuries to come.\n\nWhat comes next is this: Trump is going to lose the 2024 election. He was on shaky ground before this verdict and his chances won't survive the label of 'convicted felon.' Soon, mercifully, Donald Trump won't be our problem. \n\nBut we aren't free of problems. We will need to reckon - and it will be *difficult* - with the reality that even as a felon, Trump will win many states and pull many tens of millions of votes. Those voters are our problem. They live outside of reality, willfully locked in a bubble of resentment and commercialized fear-mongering, and they will find another Donald Trump.

Paying hush money for the purposes of a political campaign is not illegal.\n\nPaying hush money for the purposes of a political campaign and failing to report it to the Federal Election Commission, when the political campaign is for President of the United States *is* illegal.\n\nFalsifying business records to hide the purpose of that money and evade the mandatory reporting to the FEC is a crime in the state of New York.  \n\nThe issue is more subtle.  It's not that he paid hush money, it's that he doctored, and instructed others to doctor, business records in New York State to hide the (totally legal) use of funds in order to conceal the actual purpose of paying those funds, in order to evade the requirement that he report those funds to the FEC.  \n\nIt would have been totally legal for Trump to have paid Daniels for her story, and paid her not to talk about it in the press.  And if he did those purely for personal reasons (like to save his family the embarrassment) he wouldn't have really needed to disclose them to anyone.  But if he paid those funds to increase his odds of winning the Presidential election he was legally mandated to report those funds to the FEC.  The jury found, based on the evidence presented, that those funds were paid to increase his chances to win the presidental election, not for any personal reasons.  They likewise found he failed to report the payment of those funds to the FEC, which is a crime, but it's a federal crime and not one the State of New York has jurisdiction over.  \n\nThe jury further found that he doctored business records in order to conceal the fact that he committed a crime by failing to report the spending of campaign-related funds to the FEC.  Doctoring business records to conceal a crime is, in and of itself, a crime in the State of New York.  That's what he's convicted for.\n\nEssentially the jury found:\n\n* 1)  Trump paid, and directed others to pay certain funds used to induce people to to either purchase rights to stories in order to bury them, or to not disclose what they saw or knew (this is legal)\n* 2)  The purpose of those funds was to prevent unfavorable news stories from reaching the public eye (also legal)\n* 3)  The purpose of attempting to prevent those unfavorable news stories from reaching the public eye was to influence the 2016 Presidential Election (ALSO legal)\n* 4)  Trump failed to disclose the spending of those funds, spent with the intent of influencing the 2016 Presidential Election to the Federal Election Commission (illegal, but that's a federal crime, and one the state of New York has no jurisdiction to prosecute over)\n* 5)  Trump doctored, or directed others to doctor, business records of his New York based business to hide the true purpose of those funds (this is a misdemeanor in the state of new york)\n* 6)  The purpose behind doctoring those records was to conceal the fact that Trump committed a crime by failing to report the payment of those funds to the FEC (the failure to do so is a federal crime)\n* 7)  Doctoring business records in NY for the purposes of concealing a crime (any crime, state or federal) elevates the misdemeanor to a felony\n* 8)  Trump did this 34 times.",

His story, just as Kamala's, embraces the American dream - that every person has the freedom and opportunity to succeed.^[[1]](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cleyjp5qldno)\n\n\n>The 60-year-old brings with him a folksy, plain-spoken and sharp-tongued approach to taking on the Republican opposition.\n\n>He also comes with a compelling resume - a public school teacher, football coach and National Guardsman before he entered politics.\n\n>His political experience, representing a Republican-leaning district in Congress and then later passing left-wing policies as Minnesota's governor, could have broad appeal at a time when American politics is so polarised.\n\n>A native of rural Nebraska, Mr Walz farmed and hunted in his summertimes and enlisted in the Army National Guard at 17. He would serve in the volunteer force for 24 years.\n\n>His father, a public school administrator, encouraged him to join the military before he died from lung cancer when Mr Walz was 19.\n\n>The Minnesota governor has spoken of how Social Security survivor benefits sustained his mother, and how the GI Bill paid for his college education.\n\n_________\n\n1) [BBC - The ex-football coach and teacher - now Harris's VP pick](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cleyjp5qldno)",

Feel free to (please) steal this and put it somewhere more visible. It's just an AI transcription.\n\n---\n\nJOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR.\n\nJuly 21, 2024\n\nMy Fellow Americans,\n\nOver the past three and a half years, we have made great progress as a Nation.\n\nToday, America has the strongest economy in the world. We\u2019ve made historic investments in rebuilding our Nation, in lowering prescription drug costs for seniors, and in expanding affordable health care to a record number of Americans. We\u2019ve provided critically needed care to a million veterans exposed to toxic substances. Passed the first gun safety law in 30 years. Appointed the first African American woman to the Supreme Court. And passed the most significant climate legislation in the history of the world. America has never been better positioned to lead than we are today.\n\nI know none of this could have been done without you, the American people. Together, we overcame a once in a century pandemic and the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. We\u2019ve protected and preserved our Democracy. And we\u2019ve revitalized and strengthened our alliances around the world.\n\nIt has been the greatest honor of my life to serve as your President. And while it has been my intention to seek reelection, I believe it is in the best interest of my party and the country for me to stand down and to focus solely on fulfilling my duties as President for the remainder of my term.\n\nI will speak to the Nation later this week in more detail about my decision.\n\nFor now, let me express my deepest gratitude to all those who have worked so hard to see me reelected. I want to thank Vice President Kamala Harris for being an extraordinary partner in all this work. And let me express my heartfelt appreciation to the American people for the faith and trust you have placed in me.\n\nI believe today what I always have: that there is nothing America can\u2019t do \u2013 when we do it together. We just have to remember we are the United States of America.\n\n(Signature)",

It's hard to envision where America's democracy goes after a decision like this.",

Orders the Navy\u2019s Seal Team 6 to assassinate a political rival? Immune. Organizes a military coup to hold onto power? Immune. Takes a bribe in exchange for a pardon? Immune. Immune, immune, immune.\u201d\n\nedit: from the majority:\n\n>(3) Presidents cannot be indicted based on conduct for which they are immune from prosecution. On remand, the District Court must carefully analyze the indictment\u2019s remaining allegations to determine whether they too involve conduct for which a President must be immune from prosecution. And the parties and the District Court must ensure that sufficient allegations support the indictment\u2019s charges without such conduct. **Testimony or private records of the President or his advisers probing such conduct may not be admitted as evidence at trial.** Pp. 30\u201332\n\nAn incredible amount of evidence of a president's criminal acts are inadmissible to the Supreme Court! What this means:\n\n>Finally, Roberts does concede that the president may be prosecuted for \u201cunofficial\u201d acts. So, for example, if Trump had personally attempted to shoot and kill then-presidential candidate Joe Biden in the lead-up to the 2020 election, rather than ordering a subordinate to do so, then Trump could probably be prosecuted for murder.\n\n>But even this caveat to Roberts\u2019s sweeping immunity decision is not very strong. Roberts writes that \u201cin dividing official from unofficial conduct, courts may not inquire into the President\u2019s motives.\u201d And Roberts even limits the ability of prosecutors to pursue a president who accepts a bribe in return for committing an official act, such as pardoning a criminal who pays off the president. In Roberts\u2019s words, a prosecutor may not \u201cadmit testimony or private records of the President or his advisers probing the official act itself.\u201d\n\n>That means that, [while the president can be prosecuted for an \u201cunofficial\u201d act, the prosecutors may not prove that he committed this crime using evidence drawn from the president\u2019s \u201cofficial\u201d actions.](https://www.vox.com/scotus/358292/supreme-court-trump-immunity-dictatorship)\n\n>The practical implications of this ruling are astounding. As Justice Sonia Sotomayor writes in a dissenting opinion, \u201cimagine a President states in an official speech that he intends to stop a political rival from passing legislation that he opposes, no matter what it takes to do so,\u201d it follows from Roberts\u2019s opinion that the ensuing murder indictment \u201ccould include no allegation of the President\u2019s public admission of premeditated intent to support\u201d the proposition that the president intended to commit murder.",

Are official acts anything that falls within the constitutional powers of the president, or is it anything the president has given direct mandates to have done? Can actions to reverse an election be considered official acts if Trump directly ordered them? Would the retention of classified documents be considered official and done during his presidency, or are they considered outside the time period because the crime itself is retaining documents AFTER leaving office, specifically obstruction of justice for not returning them?\n\nAlso, to my knowledge this does not provide protection for any federal crimes committed after office, and of course has no impact on state crimes as they directly specify \u201cfederal prosecution\u201d.",

The lower courts should thus answer these essential questions concerning the special counsel's appointment before proceeding,\" Thomas added.\n\n\nThomas explained that he was writing a separate opinion, in support of the majority, to highlight that Smith may have been illegally appointed.\n\n\n\n\"Few things would threaten our constitutional order more than criminally prosecuting a former President for his official acts. Fortunately, the Constitution does not permit us to chart such a dangerous course,\" he wrote, before focusing on Smith's appointment.\n\n\n\"I write separately to highlight another way in which this prosecution may violate our constitutional structure. In this case, the Attorney General purported to appoint a private citizen as Special Counsel to prosecute a former President on behalf of the United States. But, I am not sure that any office for the Special Counsel has been 'established by law,\" as the Constitution requires,\" Thomas wrote.\n\n\nIn an opinion that mirrors Trump's legal argument in his election interference case in Washington, D.C., and his classified documents hoarding case in Florida, Thomas suggested that Smith may have been unlawfully appointed.\"",

I'm almost 70 and I haven't felt this hopeful for America in a long time. \n\nI've heard comments like how she is already vice president so why hasn't she done some of the things she promising...and my reply is  she has... as vice president... but with the power of being president she can deliver a lot more. Vote Blue, Vote Harris/Walz. \n\nBy the way... I've got tears reading so many of the comments on this thread.  Amazing.",

Plus they were energized because they didn't want Trump re-elected. And I'm sure many didn't bother this go around just because they assumed Harris had it in the bag.\n\n2) Fraud. Yeah, whatever. I still 100% believe there was significant fraud in 2020. And there was a reduction in that this time because the Republicans were much more prepared for it with poll watchers, legal teams, etc.\n\nWhat the ratio of #1 and #2 above is? I'm not sure. But those are the two things I believe made up for those 17-18 million extra votes Biden had.",

        "body": "To add, people seem to think that fascism is a totalitarian form of government with cooperation from internal companies. Companies did merge with the state, the way it was done was essentially nationalization, with some autonomy granted by the party because when these industries were taken over, they were given to card carrying party members. The distinction between this and direct nationalization is incredibly thin. Hitler also created a massive union for workers.\n\nThe thing about Nazism and by extension Fascism, is that they are collectivist and totalitarian, and *expansionist*. Therefore, and the left hates hearing this, it\u2019s strongly on the left. There aren\u2019t many things that actually separate communism and fascism other than how they practically applied their regimes, and what their commune was. For Hitler it was the German race, for Stalin it was the working class, and for Mussolini it was the Italian people. They all favored totalitarian collectivism and were all aggressively expansionist. Communism, unlike Italy and Germany, still believed in an international revolution. Many people forget that even before Hitler and Mussolini became relevant the communists had formed Comintern that advocated for an international revolution (and was succeeded by Cominform).\n\nAdd to all of this that, as another commenter said, Hitler hated the Jews because he said that they were international capitalists. The reason that communists and the burgeoning Nazi part kept fighting in the lead up to Hitler becoming chancellor, was *not* because they were diametrically opposed in ideology. They disagreed on how to apply socialism (so example 1,304,678 of the left eating itself)\n\nSo you have 3 ideologies that are totalitarian, collectivist, and believed in aggressive expansion. This is far from what the right would be propping up. What frustrates me the most is that historians (I am guessing that they are somewhat lefty in their own right) defend the notion that fascism is on the \u201cright\u201d which logically just does not make any sense. Unless we are talking about strictly leftist forms of government where national socialism and Italian fascism are slightly to the right of that, then sure they are on the \u201cright\u201d.",

But everyone outside the state is inferior), while the latter was racist in a biological way (e.g. everyone who was not a nordic-germanic aryan with a 57cm skull circumference, is inferior). This means that co-governance would actually be impossible because the fascists would have to execute people whom they considered to be equal under the state but the nazis viewed as racial inferiors. The Jews are a good example of this. Hitler tried to persecute Italian Jews, but mussolini never really cooperated. Funny thing is there were 10,000 Jews in the fascist party of Italy. Oh and, would you believe me if I told you the philosophical founder of fascism (Giovanni Gentile) helped Jews escape from National Socialist custody? \n\nMussolini was staunchly opposed to Hitler's anschluss of austria, and he sent divisions into the mountains of northern Italy to deter Hitler. Also, there are tonnes of quotes by Mussolini, Hitler, and Goebbels where they talk down on each other's ideology. \n\nHitler thought that Mussolini's fascism was crap. Hitler also claimed to be \"a true socialist\". So there's that.\n\nIt was only when they were in the same sinking ship that they decided to team up (both were excluded from the league of nations, both were facing economic sanctions from the west). \n\nTLDR: I agree but I take it one step further: Nazism is not fascism, it is National SOCIALISM.

Vance, coming out of Ohio, didn't represent that, so I mostly considered him a non-entity.\n\nHe has since proved himself to be well-spoken, intelligent, and pretty funny, too, and I think he'll make a great president. But at the right time, he needs to be put forward and allowed to be the face of the conservative movement.  Maybe put in Lara Trump as his vice presidential candidate to appeal to women, as she will represent the Trump name and the wave that followed him personally. I see *her* as the obvious face of the next generation, rather than Don Jr., who probably works better as a fundraiser and organizer, and Barron is too young and hasn't accomplished anything yet.",

But my rational brain doesn't find it very difficult to point at multiple different reasons for his massive win.  \n\n1.  The Economy.  Despite the economy booming by numerous different metrics... those aren't the metrics that resonate with the average voter.  Grocery prices are astronomical.  Interest rates are astronomical.  Voters don't care about the nuances of those things.  They know Biden was the President and Harris was his VP and she didn't make any meaningful differentiation in how she would approach those issues.  Trump benefits from having inherited an already booming economy and presided over it as it continued its upward trajectory for over 3 years before COVID.  Voters just don't seem to give a shit that he's hopelessly ignorant on economic issues and just gifted him back ANOTHER booming economy that he'll almost certainly fuck up.\n\n2.  Kamala as a candidate.  She stuck to her talking points and those talking points just didn't scratch the itch of the numerous questions she needed to answer.  It also left most voters feeling she was inauthentic.  As horrible of a human being as Donald Trump is, people view his bullshit as honesty even if they might not appreciate the stuff he says.  \n\n3.  \"Woke-ism\".  The Republicans are able to align mainstream Democrats with the most radical Leftists and did so relentlessly.  I'm a Liberal and pro-LGBT.  But... I also do not believe trans women should be competing against biological women in sports.  And I don't believe that should be controversial.  Trans issues, while important, should NOT be a primary issue Democrats grapple with when less than a single % of Americans are trans.  There are so many crazy ass leftists who do and believe absolutely absurd shit and the Republicans were able to paint Kamala as one of them.  The average American voter is absolutely disgusted by \"safe spaces\" and \"gender fluidity\" and all the other nonsense that has been cultivated on college campuses.  The next candidate is going to have to find a way to parse this issue because failing to distance themselves from the most radical beliefs on the Left will be painted as embracing them by the Right.\n\n4.  Messaging.  Democrats fucking SUCK at messaging.  They SUCK at explaining what they've done for the American people in ways the American people can relate to.  They SUCK at explaining WHY Trump is so awful in ways the American people can relate to.  Just calling Trump a threat to democracy and a fascist and all that, while objectively true, does absolutely nothing to move the needle without explaining WHY those things would affect the average hard working American.\n\nI think there were a ton of other reasons, but those are the ones that stick out in my mind.",

In a minor way, it undermined the message on Democracy^tm but it also but Harris in a position where she couldn't hone a message of her own when she had barely more than 100 days. Couple that with the early high of her candidacy and her bunker strategy, she couldn't distinguish herself from Joe Biden and no one would believe her tacks to the center were genuine because she couldn't articulate why 2024 Harris was different from 2019 Harris.\n\n3) DEI/Woke/Identity/Intersectional politics (whatever you want to call it) is a drag and doesn't serve the groups it purports to serve.

Kamala made her campaign a referendum on Trump. Problem is that people look back on past administrations with nostalgia, especially since Trump happened to preside over an economic boom. Memories of the daily scandals and crimes get fuzzier with time.\n6. Kamala's fascism attacks did not work because most Americans are not very informed about what happened on Jan 6. It is difficult to thoroughly explain what happened that was so dangerous and unprecedented. Without that knowledge, throwing around the word \"fascist\" sounds like Dems are just mean bullies who want to call Trump names.\n7. Kamala also centered her campaign on seemingly pleading with people to care about the rights of others. The Obamas told men to vote for Kamala because they should care about the women in their lives. She begged Americans to reject the misogyny and bullying of Trump's brand. The issue is that most working class Americans view these as elite, boutique issues and either don't care, or are outright socially conservative.\n8.

Although he tried to overturn democracy, most Americans only remember that everything turned out okay in the end, so it probably wasn't a big deal.

        "body": "I don't think it was campaign strategy, or Harris's policy decisions that lost the election. It wasn't any of the comparatively little fights. For all the hemming and hawing, the decisive factor didn't end up being the border or Afghanistan or the IRA or Liz Cheney or Walz/Shapiro or even Gaza, I think. Progressives weren't turned off by appeals to the middle, and the middle wasn't turned off by appeals to the left. The \"right\" demographics, in the right amounts and in the right places, all turned out. They weren't turned off. They just voted for Trump. \n\nI think the main reasons are more structural:\n\n* **Biden Not Dropping Out:** The Democratic Party ran an 82-year-old massively unpopular incumbent for half the cycle. Even if I don't think Harris failing to create policy daylight between herself and the unpopular Biden *actually* mattered in itself, Biden handed Kamala an awful starting position. This, however, only put Kamala behind the 8 ball. It didn't actually *lose* the election, in my opinion. Because...\n* **Inflation:** Regardless of the actual statistical profile of the economy -- earnings are outpacing inflation for the median American, and wage growths are fastest for the lowest earners -- people simply do not like watching prices go up. Spending power doesn't matter; if you do stimulus in response to adverse economic shocks, you're fucked. This is why the COVID-era elections have all ended with incumbent parties getting punished at the ballot box. If things go poorly during a term, the incumbent gets punished.\n* **The Trump Platform:** If the turnout and the demographics were all right for Kamala to win, but people voted for Trump anyway, it suggests that people *genuinely preferred Trump's vision for the country.* \n\nThis all probably means that *no* Democrat would have won this cycle. If this is what the electorate looked like, and if people really blamed the Democratic Party for the economic downturns caused by COVID, then I really don't think it was campaign or platform choices by the Harris-Walz campaign that lost them the race.",

It allows dems to finally regain a sense of normalcy within their party without having to constantly disavow wild fringe leftist ideologies. The difference is that the republican party is entirely insane to have Trump as their nominee. It\u2019s the whole fucking party, not fringe outliars that are just making the majority look bad.",

They feel like the modern world is against them, and seeing Trump get battered around by the legal system and the press makes them think he is in the same boat. So when you tell them that Trump is a rapist and a criminal and a would-be dictator, they don't care. They think he is their friend, so he will be careful to direct those evil traits towards their enemies. Its like owning a vicious dog. He will bite everyone but you, because he is *your* vicious dog. \n\nNow, just because bats and butterflies both have wings does not mean they are in any way related. Trump has almost nothing in common with most of his voters. Breaking this stupid illusion might be pretty effective for peeling voters off of Trump. Its worth a shot.",

There's too much distrust in a salesperson that won't stop talking about how bad their competitors are. Quite frankly for any industry, the more you talk trash on your competitors the worst you end up looking. I think the Democratic party should run on a platform of policy and focus on that and that alone. However, they won't because we've learned that people can get elected without having any policy. It's easier to sell the end of democracy or anger to get boats that it is to actually come up with a plan to fix this country.

Maybe a bit off. This will be around the DNC. Closer to the election, mid September or so, it will become scary. \"It's scary that such creepy men might become kings. Remember Jan 6th? It's even more terrifying that Trump is so old that he will die and that couch obsessed Vance might become president.

He does that little smug chuckle, but I've never seen him have a good belly laugh in public. It paints the dems as joyful and happy and hopeful for a better future, while Trump is as much of a downer as the preacher from footloose. \n\nPossible bonus: it gets people making fun of Trump, which is one of the few ways to really get under his skin.

I'm trying to think of potential things that could push them over the edge and coming up with nothing. Let's be honest - Trump typically has a weekly scandal big enough to end any other politician's career. They don't hold Trump to the same standard they hold every other politician to and I honestly don't think that is anything to brag about. It's why many call them a cult.\n\nI think his non-core supporters are still reachable (though not easily), but his core supporters are lost. And if some scandal or health issue was bad enough to peel off some of his non-core supporters, most would probably switch to third party or not vote at all before voting Biden.\n\nOne thing I could see seriously hurting Trump or Biden is a major health decline. And I'm not talking about the old age stuff we already see from both of them. You're lying to yourself if you say Trump is in better mental and physical shape than Biden (and vice versa). We should already be concerned about both of them. But picture one of them doing a public event and freezing for a minute like Mitch McConnell.

Today's Harris is a surprise to everyone, maybe including the candidate herself. But regarding Trump, Biden's departure has turned the spotlight on what was really a baseline of delusional reality, but exacerbated in the aftermath of the debate as even more repetitive and nonsensical. His stump has lost the political Don Rickles cavalcade of stream of consciousness insults that his fan base eats up, and instead increasingly repetitive riffs on sharks, EVs, and Hannibal Lecter. So I think his handlers have seen this looming train wreck and simply are pulling him off the tracks, hoping upon hope for some sort of repair.\n\nBut Vance has proven to be not only an empty suit, but a simply poor politician as well. Between ham-handedly fighting off couch and dolphin allegations, when he does try to strike out on policy he finds yet another constituency to alienate. But he's all the GOP has, there are essentially no other surrogates worth a damn, right now it's Vance or let the Dems run roughshod over the next 90 days to a tsunami in November. Which I think is increasingly likely.\n\nAs a Reagan through GW Bush Republican, this couldn't happen to a better skeleton of a party, so I'm sitting back with popcorn waiting for it all to burn to the ground (I expect it to take a few more election cycles).

        "body": "Historically, running for President when one is the VP of an unpopular incumbent has spelled disaster for that campaign. But 2024 is unique in that Biden\u2019s unpopularity with a majority of potential voters has way more to do with concerns around his mental acuity than it does with disillusionment with his policies. For that reason, substituting Biden with Harris flipped election odds back in favor of Democrats; the problem was the candidate, not the platform or record. It is apparent that the historically low favorability ratings of Biden in recent months specifically had to do with him, not with the party itself.\n\nRight from when Trump launched his first campaign in 2015, he\u2019s never been a particularly strong candidate. He never stays on message, he knows nothing about policy specifics, and he comes with tons of baggage. He has only been successful when his opposition has been weak. \n\nWhile Trump went up against more politically experienced opposition in the 2016 Republican Primaries, none of these candidates had the Television presence or charisma required to be a successful candidate in this era. His general election opponent Hillary Clinton had a lot of experience, but also lacked charisma, had tons of controversies, baggage, a bad campaign team, and showed poor political instincts (picking a VP who is even less charismatic than her, and not focusing on the midwest).\n\nIn 2020 he lost to Biden, and it\u2019s not like Biden ran some masterful campaign; Biden was in his basement for most of the campaign, and Trump literally only lost because of his own poor governance and his erratic behavior. When it came time to face a candidate with less baggage and who was relatively more presentable than him, Trump lost. \n\nIn this 2024 campaign, Trump was only leading until recent weeks due to Biden\u2019s cognitive decline. Even at the recent debate with Biden, it\u2019s not like Trump laid some masterful trap that Biden fell into; once again, Trump completely floundered at the debate by not answering a single question, but this got overshadowed by the signs of Biden\u2019s decline. Even though Biden lost, Trump didn\u2019t win that debate.\n\nNow with Harris, Trump for the first time is facing a general election opponent who is substantially younger than him. While she has her own flaws as a candidate, none of her baggage compares to Trump\u2019s own baggage, so people don\u2019t care much about Harris\u2019s flaws. On top of that, Harris has shown better political instincts than Hillary Clinton did by selecting a VP pick who is charismatic and balances out her own weaknesses as a candidate, a VP pick that correctly focuses on the most critical electoral region: the midwest. \n\nThe Harris-Walz campaign has also very successfully branded the Trump-Vance campaign with two tactically brilliant criticisms: 1) that they\u2019re weird, and 2) that they\u2019re joyless. These criticisms are brilliant because many swing voters vote based on who they want to have a beer with (the candidate who they find to be more relatable). Nobody wants to have a beer with someone who they find to be weird and pessimistic.\n\nTrump has painted himself into a corner with his own bad judgement and erratic behavior. He ruined the goodwill he had after his assassination attempt by further spewing divisive rhetoric. Nobody takes Trump seriously when he calls his opponent a liar, because Trump is objectively the biggest liar in recent American politics. Nobody takes him seriously when he claims Tim Walz is unpopular, because most Americans have a way more favorable opinion of Walz than they do of Vance. Nobody takes Trump seriously when he calls Harris a criminal, when Trump himself is a convicted felon who is still facing multiple pending felony counts and charges. The \u201cstolen valor\u201d controversy he wants to stir up against Walz seems extra ridiculous considering that Trump used bone spurs as an excuse to dodge service in Vietnam. Trump claims that the left is crazy and divisive, when Trump himself is doing more than any individual to push the boundaries of craziness and divisiveness in politics with his rhetoric.\n\nAt this point, the only way I see Trump winning this election is for him to depend on the same potential outcome he always has: hoping that his opposition screws up. That\u2019s really it. Trump completely lacks the self-discipline and restraint required to win an election on one\u2019s own merit when the opposition is strong. Harris does have weaknesses, but I don\u2019t think Trump is in a state to be able to exploit these weaknesses, as he seems to be spiraling into insanity in real time. If things continue as they stand now, I\u2019m confident that Harris will win this election and become the next President. It\u2019s on her now to ensure she doesn\u2019t screw up her campaign.",

I listen to channels like Pod Save America and other political YouTube channels on a regular basis and genuinely like discussions about policy. I also stay tapped into shows like John Oliver, the Daily Show, etc.\n\nDespite these interests, a lot of the names being brought up by people in this thread are people that I know nothing about. I don't know who Kelly or Shapiro are, or any of the other names being discussed. I imagine that these are people that are popular to (a) people in their respective states and (b) people who are a lot more up to date on Democrat leaders/personalities specifically.\n\nPeople need to understand though that these are not people that have wide name recognition. They are not talked about on a regular basis in any of political commentary shows/podcasts I brought up. Maybe they have been mentioned once or twice in passing, but not often. And if I don't know who they are, then the chance of the average American knowing them or having a favorable opinion on them is very low. And if the Republicans engage in a rigorous campaign to dig up dirt on them, then the first time people will hear of them will be in a negative light. \n\nI could be wrong about this (I'm not a political scientist) but I just wanted to express these concerns because I've heard name recognition is really important in elections and that voters generally prefer candidates that they have built a relationship with and knowledge about over time.. They don't like being in a situation where they are looking at a ballot and don't know who one of the candidates is (which realistically might happen if we picked someone unrecognizable by most, especially with how late they will have to start campaigning). Harris has that name recognition, and there is no dirt on her that Republicans haven't already brought up before.",

If you look at the last few Democratic candidates (Biden, Clinton, Obama's second term), so much of the campaign was defined *years* in advance due to each candidate being the 'likely' candidate for the next term.  This allowed right wing media to form a narrative about the candidates years in advance and just hammer it incessantly.\n\nObviously that isn't going to happen here, since the drumbeat they were pounding was Biden's age.  I have little doubt that media outlets with an agenda will be trying to find whatever dirt or story they can, but I have to imagine it will not be as effective as in the past few cycles just because they haven't been priming their viewers and the media ecosystem as a whole for the past few years.\n\nI doubt this will matter much for the perennial right wing media consumers, but I wonder if it will matter for more moderate voters and more neutral media sources.",

Literally hundreds of millions of dollars to spend (and growing) with a short amount of time to spend it all, and she doesn\u2019t have the job of president to do on the side so she really can put her whole focus into the campaign. \n\nI think a lesson could be learned here about how to nominate candidates in the modern environment. People want someone fresh to hit the scene, and they get tired of politicians really fast. Look at how DeSantis fizzled out, because he hit the scene too early. This might prompt us to go back to the old nomination process, where it\u2019s truly kept to the convention, and we don\u2019t know who the nominees will be until a few months before the election. That\u2019s unlikely because of the race for campaign funds and the primary infrastructure in place, but honestly it\u2019s better this way.

Trump\u2019s disastrous policy of \u201cmetering\u201d \u2014 limiting the number of asylum applications accepted each day \u2014 forces people seeking asylum to wait on the streets in often dangerous Mexican border towns for weeks before they are permitted to apply. It has created a horrifying ecosystem of violence and exploitation, with cartels kidnapping, violently assaulting, and extorting migrants. Biden will direct the necessary resources to ensure asylum applications are processed fairly and e!ciently (sic), while treating families and children with compassion and sensitivity.\n\nAt the end of FY2024, the Immigration Court backlog stood at 3,698,580 cases -- an increase of 903,951 cases in a single year, up from the 2,794,629 case backlog at the end of FY2023 -- and an increase of 2,435,815 cases (or nearly 300%) from the 1,457,547 cases that were backlogged at the end of FY2020.

Obviously no Republicans actually care how the Democrats select their nominee and they don't care if Democratic voters are bothered by it. \n\nThey just want Democratic voters to be bothered by it, but they (we) aren't.

Trump's game is the same as Reagan Game, both played the \"*Trickle Down Delusion*\" when in fact it was based in funneling financial benefit to the top groups of wealthy entities and people, and ensuring their taxes are cut and they get as many tax exemption as can be provided. \n\nThat gambit madness, has never been good for the Working Class, and it never will be, because it was never by design for the benefit of the working class.    The wealthy have \"*never liked paying taxes*\".  But they love every benefit that Tax dollars create, which helps their business thrive and their communities maintain in superior condition. \n\nTrump removed regulation and protection that had been carefully crafted to protect the economy and to protect the citizens economic engagement, as well as to protect the stability of business and financial institution.    He has absolutely *No Respect* for the Consumer Protection Agency, *No Respect* for the Fair Trade Commission,  and *No Respect* or Awareness or Concern to strengthen and improve oversight of the Bond Rating Agencies.  Trump has absolutely not concern for the value that HUD is to the economy, even when he himself benefits from the Section 8 programs which he profits from in the Apartments he inherited from his father.   He swindled his own family out of their % share of those assets.    He has no knowledge of how important the EPA or the Dept. of Education is to the Economy, if he did he would not have been trying to attack and destroy those Departments and Agencies. \n\nTrump knows that his followers know *even less about the importance of these Agencies and Departments* to the well being of the Economy. \n\nRepublican as a whole ignore and disregard how important The Social Security is to the Economy, because if they did, they'd known that money is spent back into the Economy.    The same with Medicare, that money is put back into the system which funds doctors, hospitals, and a vast array of business and industries.      He has no concept of understanding how important it is for the wealthy to pay their taxes, because that money is put back into the system by and through the programs and services it provides, which in process employees people in every state in the nation. \n\nHis tax cuts hurt the economy and the nation, which means less money for infrastructure and less money for every things the government does which invest in society where that money is spent back into the economy.  \n\nSo, he should not make any crazy claims as if he is good for the Economy.     The only economy he cares about is the \"wealthy getting and hoarding more money',  which turns out to suppress the economy, as the wealthy find any way and every way they can to hide and shelter that money, which means, that money ceases to circulate into the economy.     \n\nOur Economy works best when \"money circulates', not when money is stashed offshore and hidden by any and every mean the wealthy have devised to hoard it.",

The ability to reclassify income is often a major source of revenue response in conventional tax scoring. As such, a considerable number of additional details would be needed to score this provision.\"\n\nI think trying to paint specific numbers as gospel when the source of those numbers directly says that one side of it is missing a lot of information is silly. \n\nThat said, I don't need a study to show that Trump is happy to spend and cut regardless of budget, and I don't think that any of them are serious about tackling it.",

Do you what\u2019s better for them then they do?\n\n3.) Besides just losing support for Palestine, it\u2019s worth considering that Biden has many other things that make him look weak, such as the continuing impact of inflation, the failure of his larger loan forgiveness promises, his age (yes trump is also old but Biden looks frail as hell), and the fact that he can\u2019t even get a client state (Israel) to ease up even a little bit in the current conflict (I count this as separate from the moral scrutiny he\u2019s under and moreso a critique of his foreign policy statesmanship.\n\n4.) a line for bullshit and basic expectations has to be drawn somewhere, and this is my line. I voted for Hilary even though I voted for Bernie in the primaries. I voted for Biden even though I voted for Bernie in the primaries. But this?

Taking a breath, pausing and then speaking is a pretty core strategy and often speaking in fast, racing sentences is what will set a stutter off. As we age, our reflexes decline and Biden likely has to focus even more on being able to articulate himself clearly than he would\u2019ve 20 years ago. \n\nI also think that Biden\u2019s age has a lot more attention courtesy of the media, they\u2019re actively searching for his gaffes and mistakes as \u2018evidence\u2019 when a lot of it is likely things that happen to anybody. As someone who has worked intimately with people suffering from different forms of dementia, Biden is not one of them. Absolutely some cognitive slowing that\u2019s in line with natural aging, but I think a lot of it comes down to him being a reserved person with a known speech impediment in a public sphere. Then knowing you\u2019ve got reporters looking for any and all evidence of \u2018dementia\u2019 would increase anxiety, resulting in pauses, muddling up words and misspeaking.\n\n\nTrump has always been boisterous and loud, with no speech impediment and enough narcissism to carry him through public rallies with a lack of anxiety. He speaks absolutely nonsense but because he says it loudly and with conviction, no one actually pays attention to the lack of policy or attention to detail in his speeches.

It could be that this will be mitigated by both the freshness of a younger candidate and the horrors of project 2025. It will be hard to balance what progressives and centrist voters want. \n\nBut the other element is that the gop is not giving any new solutions and is in fact catering to a pretty extreme minority right now. That may mean any voters who are not rabid maga-ites may not be inclined to vote this time which would pave the way for more progressive younger voters to actually make their vote count. \n\nBut I do not claim any inside knowledge for any political party",

And anyone who thinks the polls in July that had Trump comfortably in control of every single state were set in stone doesn't know a damn thing. \n\nI still personally think the Dems are going to way overperform this election like they have been consistently for years now. I get we don't exactly have data to support this, but also definitionally you wouldn't. That's what \"overperform\" means. It's little things like this article that indicate why I think it will happen.",

As a mathematician, I know that a poll is only valid if the questions asked are not looking for a specific answer - in other words are not biased.  The fact that the article mentions his friend Newt Gingrich and the Contract with America shows how right wing he is.  Gingrich was one of the major reasons why Congress went from being a group that could find compromise to one in which the GOP stopped progress on any program that would help anyone other than the rich.  They literally threaten their colleagues to get what they want.  I remember a Congress in which compromise was expected.  \n\nThe answer to the question about why women are voting is really quite simple.  THEIR RIGHTS ARE BEING TAKEN AWAY.  Vance, Johnson and other GOP have made it clear just what they believe women should be doing - staying home & raising kids.  Many of the younger people see exactly who T is, a liar and a womanizer, who cares only about the rich & denigrates everyone else.  The GOP has been trying to run away from Project 2025, but it's too late.  Their education plan for years has shown that they don't believe that all kids deserve a good education.  They want what the Robber Barons had - all the money & all the power.",

They\u2019re informed, they\u2019re open-minded but carefully critical, and they know how to use the internet without falling into death traps of misinformation. Does this encapsulate all of Gen Z? No. But I do think they\u2019re often underestimated by older folks in just how informed they are of their decisions. \n\nThey\u2019re still kids, but they also grew up in a world where the opportunities millenials and gen x saw at their age, were dried up by the time they started having dreams about their own futures. They may not have anything to compare the last 8 years to, but many have watched their parents struggle and sacrifice things that shaped their own ideas of adulthood. Even the way Gen Z has entered the workforce and their ability to \u201cmatch the energy\u201d of ignorant, asshole customers in jobs heavily dominated by other kids their age is vastly different than what has been seen before. Just the way they refuse to conform to the expectations of shitty management is admirable.  \n\nSomeone mentioned that Trump comes with no baggage for them, but neither does the bullshit that all elections come with. They\u2019re not flooding political discussion threads after absorbing every article and tidbit of information and dissecting it, because they haven\u2019t been burdened by the weight of the last 8 years. But that doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re not paying attention. Voter registration for individuals under 35 shot up 700% after Biden announced his withdraw and endorsed Kamala. And her campaign didn\u2019t miss a second in pushing out memes and jokes targeted at young voters. \n\nAgain, this obviously isn\u2019t ALL Gen Z, but Kamala\u2019s TikTok campaign is killing it with their generation while also providing context as to what they\u2019re voting for. What many of us felt for Obama, they\u2019re feeling for Kamala and Tim because until July 21st, the world felt heavy and dark for almost a decade, and they\u2019re feeling hope for the first time. They\u2019re about vibes and sincerity and Trump fails at both.  The biggest hurdle for them is going to be the same as all voters: don't get complacent and make it a priority to vote.",

The Biden admin has had many furrowed brows and \u201ctense conversations\u201d and that seems to make Bibi mad but it hasn\u2019t changed that we have given them every weapon they have asked for and then some (we sent in air craft carriers to break a blockade).\u00a0\n\nAs someone whose actual stance is something close to stop all arms immediately, compromise would be something like conditional arms sales, under conditions of a one state solution with equal rights for Palestine and Jews.

It did not have the right to destroy Gaza's infrastructure, housing, and health care system  It did not have the right to bomb every one of Gaza's 12 universities. It did not have the right to block humanitarian aid, causing massive malnutrition in children and, in fact, starvation. \n> \n> And that is why I am doing everything I can to block US military aid and offensive weapon sales to the right wing extremist Netanyahu government in Israel.\n> \n> And I know that many of you share those feelings, and some of you are saying: \u201cHow can I vote for Kamala Harris if she is supporting this terrible war?\u201d And that is a very fair question. And let me give you my best answer.\n> \n> And that is that even on this issue, Donald Trump and his right-wing friends are worse. \n> \n> In the Senate, in Congress the Republicans have worked overtime to block humanitarian aid to the starving children in Gaza. The President and Vice President both support getting as much humanitarian aid into Gaza as soon as possible.\n> \n> Trump has said Netanyahu is \u201cdoing a good job\u201d and has said Biden is holding him back. He has suggested that the Gaza Strip would make excellent beachfront property for development. And it is no wonder Netanyahu prefers to have Donald Trump in office \n> \n> But even more importantly, and this I promise you, after Kamala wins, we will together do everything that we can to change US policy toward Netanyahu. An immediate ceasefire, the return of all hostages, a surge of massive humanitarian aid, the stopping of settler attacks on the West Bank, and the rebuilding of Gaza for the Palestinian people.\n> \n> And let me be clear. We will have, in my view, a much better chance of changing US policy with Kamala than with Trump, who is extremely close to Netanyahu and sees him as a like-minded, right wing extremist ally.\n> \n> But let me also say this, and I deal with this every single day as a US senator. As important as Gaza is, and as strongly as many of us feel about this issue, it is not the only issue at stake in this election. If Trump wins, women in this country will suffer an enormous setback and lose the ability to control their own bodies. That is not acceptable.\n> \n> If Trump wins, to be honest with you, the struggle against climate change is over. While virtually every scientist who has studied the issue understands that climate change is real and an existential threat to our country and the world, Trump believes it is a hoax\n> \n> And if the United States, the largest economy in the world, stops transforming our energy system away from fossil fuel, every other country, China, Europe, all over the world, they will do exactly the same thing.\n> \n> And God only knows the kind of planet we will leave to our kids and future generations. \n> \n> If Trump wins at a time of massive income and wealth inequality, he will demand even more tax breaks for the very richest people in our country, while cutting back on programs that working families desperately need. The rich will only get richer, while the minimum wage will remain at $7.25 an hour, and millions of our fellow workers will continue to earn starvation wages. \n> \n> Did you all see the recent Trump rally at Madison Square Garden? Well, I did, and what I can tell you is that as a nation, as all of you know, we have struggled for years against impossible odds to try to overcome all forms of bigotry, whether it is racism, whether it's sexism, whether it's homophobia, whether it's xenophobia, you name it. \n> \n> We have tried to fight against bigotry, but that is exactly what we saw on display at that unbelievable Trump rally.  It was not a question of speakers getting up there disagreeing with Kamala Harris on the issues. That wasn't the issue at all. They were attacking her simply because she was a woman and a woman of color. Extreme vulgar sexism and racism. \n> \n> Is that really the kind of America that we can allow? \n> \n> So let me conclude by saying this: This is the most consequential election in our lifetimes.\n> Many of you have differences of opinion with Kamala Harris on Gaza. \n> \n> So do I.\n> \n> But we cannot sit this election out. \n> \n> Trump has got to be defeated. \n> \n> Let's do everything we can in the next week to make sure that Kamala Harris is our next president.\n> \n> Thank you very much.\n>",

Even Sanders failed to do enough. Only immediate action by the Biden administration could have made a difference and he failed. \n\nThose who were persuadable, like Rashida Talib, have at least officially come out to support Harris as a better alternative to Trump, but not all her supporters have. \n\nMy only concern is that those who are set to sit it out or vote third party may just get desperate enough to actually vote from Trump. This is a well-educated population and can distinguish political posturing from reality.  They can differentiate between some temporary immigration restriction from a limited number of countries \\[less than a handful\\] and the rhetoric of Muslim ban under the Trump administration.

If me not voting is going to lose Kamala the election, then as a self-interested politician, she should make concessions to my position to earn my vote.\n\nB) The conflict in Gaza is a genocide, and genocide is a red line that cannot be crossed. Any support for it is morally indefensible. \n\nThe argument Donald Trump is worse conflicts with A, and the argument that they should compromise conflicts with B. Both seem to be received poorly by this group of voters.\n\nHow to better reach them? I can't say for sure, but I think the focus needs to be on existing pro-Gaza policy & statements & on a vote for Harris as vote for the entire Democratic Coalition, which includes the Democrats currently advocating for Palestinians. Emphasize the ceasefire efforts, Biden threatening an Arms Embargo, Kamala 'boycotting' Netanyahu's speech to congress several months ago. And emphasize that Kamala being in the White House empowers the Pro-Palestinian politicians in the Democratic Party. AOC made this point really well in one or two of her recent livestreams, that having a president from the Democratic Coalition puts politicians like her, Rashida Tlaib, and Bernie Sanders in positions of power to negotiate and influence policy. I think Bernie could have alluded to the fact that he currently is championing Arms Embargo legislation in the Senate, and the fact that as a Senator in a closely split Senate, he is a key vote and could use that position to further this kind of policy goal. \n\nThat said, I think probably the majority of voters for whom Gaza is an important issue are not this disaffected protest voter block, and I think that a significant portion of the disaffected protest voter block is not interested in being reached. Anecdotally, the people I know in real life view Biden/Harris very negatively on the Gaza issue and are still planning on voting for her, having already come to the conclusions Sanders presents on their own. \n\nBut you never know for sure! Take my word with a grain of salt, all my intuition on public perception of this issue comes from my anecdotal experiences, and reading far too many arguments on twitter.",

The only people with the time and the money to do that are older people in their peak earning years. If you change that system then younger people have better odds. Or you could weaken the seniority system in congress that rewards longevity (Republicans have kinda done this with term limits for congressional committee chairs, so their members retire much more frequently. In fact more Republicans have retired in the House than Democrats in every cycle between 1996 and 2020).\n\nBut again, when push comes to shove voters will not base their decisions on age. This election proves that. Trump was a senile old man and the oldest presidential candidate in history running against a Democrat who could\u2019ve been his daughter. Yet, voters chose him despite bitching about age all year and saying Trump was less mentally fit than Harris according to polling.

Even parachute candidates immediately sit down with big local employers and major organizations in the area. But, ideally you're a local politician who has been serving for years in some smaller capacity. Mayor or state government or both over time, that sort of thing. The key there is time. Holding more local offices takes time of its own. So politicians with experience and enough local support to run for a federal party are going to be older unless they are exceptionally charismatic or special somehow. \n\n3) Free time. It's related to #1, but you need to be in a position where dedicating all your time to an uncertain election outcome, and therefore an uncertain job prospect, is still a safe enough decision.

        "body": "I think that Biden and Trump, from an age perspective, are outliers due to a specific set of circumstances that ultimately had nothing to do with age.\n\nFor example, Trump was a dark horse candidate that (initially) nobody expected to win. Ted Cruz was the expected favorite, followed by Marco Rubio and John Kasich. Cruz is 54 (right now); while I wouldn't call that young, he's still a lot younger than Biden or Trump. He's even younger than Harris by a few years. Cruz and Rubio are very close to the same age, while Kasich is closer to Trump's. My point is that if Trump didn't show up as a surprise favorite in the primaries, the Republican candidate for President would have been (at the time) 46 years old, which is not even close to an unreasonable age. That's actually exactly as old as Bill Clinton was when he became President.\n\nAs for the blue side - Clinton and Biden are roughly around the same age as Trump, but their presence in the political landscape was likely due to their association with past popular Democrat presidents. Bill Clinton and Barack Obama both had solid job approval ratings. Post-Reagan, Bill was #1 and Barack was #2. So it kind of makes sense that the Dems would tap these two for the job. Or in other words, I don't think they *couldn't* find a younger candidate. Just that there were reasons to go with these two. (Not that I think it was an amazing reason. Just that it's somewhat disconnected from the issue of age alone.)\n\nThe tl;dr version - very specific circumstances led us to the candidates we had in the 2024 election and it's not necessarily indicative of a desire to make sure we have 70+ year old people as President.\n\nI also don't think that it was Biden's age, all by itself, that was the issue. Every public speaker makes gaffes or gets tongue-tied from time to time. If you had to talk all day, you'd do it too - it's normal. The issue is that Biden very obviously had problems that went beyond just ordinary flubs. It wasn't just Fox News saying that, either. Major Democratic Party members and big-time donors pushed for it, and even the New Yorker (notable left-wing publication) wrote a scathing article about this. There wouldn't have been a push for Biden to step down if this wasn't a factor.",

You can certainly disagree with him, but that interview showed that he was more than capable of handling himself against very hostile interviewers in a coherent manner. \n\n2 - His legal issues have all but melted away. The SCOTUS ruling has eliminated some, some have been dismissed, and others are so outlandish they will certainly be dismissed in appeals. He was fined more for paying back a bank loan than Boeing was for killing two people. \n\n3 & 4 You love Trump or hate Trump. The unprecedented size of his rallies show that despite what politicians or the media think of him, people love him and would walk over gym floor covered in Legos barefoot to vote for him.

That would certainly alianate potential voters even if they agreed with his politics.\n\nHis last term went on quite well actually; but his last months were some of the most embarassing positions a US President found fall to.\n\nHe absolutely dropped the ball with Covid, a mistake that cost the lives of thousands of Americans.

The same is true of his former White House staff and former aides.\n\nNot a good look, not a big deal either. It's a general election and they all have one votes.\n\nBernie Sanders was a very controversial figure among his party, yet he was by far the most popular Democrat politician we've seen since Obama. \n\nOn the other hand, Kamala Harris was able to garner close to no following in 2020 primaries, had considerably low approval rates as VP. Yet she is highly supported among her party. \n\nSo votes/public perception and party unity don't always go hand to hand. Let's not forget Trump was hated by a lot of Republicans in 2016 as well, yet he ended up winning the election.\n\nGeneral elections is about winning swing stated, it's a lot more simple than White House politics.\n\n>4-Trump's behavior and the way he attacks opponents was a novelty in 2016, but his repeated behavior has grown formulaic after eight years.\n\nI agree it doesn't hit the same anymore. His antics in 2016 was something unseen and honestly, entertaining even if not classy. \n\nAfter 8 years though, it just doesn't have the same shock value.\n\n>5-Project 2025, which was contributed to by his campaign with his vision in mind, is deeply unpopular now that people know the details.\n\nIt's deeply unpopular among people who would never vote for him anyway. So I don't think this is much of a factor.\n\n>So should he drop out and let a more viable candidate run in his place?\n\nAgain, Republicans could've done better than Trump. \n\nYet pulling out a candidate is a radical option, one that the Democrats had to go with because of Biden's state. \n\nFor Trump, although there are certainly strong arguments for why he wasn't the best possible candidate for Republicans; not strong arguments for why he should drop out now.",

The hypocrisy of many people who were claiming Biden to be sharp, to now be questioning Trump's cognition is insanely blatant.\n\n2 - The legal issues are a moot point because many people (myself included) see that actually as a huge negative against the democratic party. The timing of the trial is incredibly questionable, and some of the people involved in the prosecution and their connections to the liberal party leave many questioning political corruption. Do you know and understand what he was charged with? I'm not claiming you don't but I know a lot of people that don't know and still use it as ammo against him, simply because the media encourages it. Trump was actually indicted because he ran for president.\n\n3 - I don't know enough about this to answer. Are you referring to Mike Pence? That would be potentially the first credible point you've made against him so far in my opinion.\n\n4 -  I think Trump is a much more polished politician than Kamala actually. At least there hasn't been any encouraged twerking at Trump rallies yet. That's a really disgraceful thing to do to politics. Also gross to tie politics to celebrities. Especially celebrities who are being investigated for some pretty gross sexual harassment charges. Not what this country needs right now lol. Also Kamala fakes a black accent depending on her crowd. I know she's technically part black but I only see that horrendous and honestly slightly racist (not the superior kind just the regular kind) accent come out for certain (black) crowds. How can that be taken as genuine?\n\n5 - Project 2025 as I understand it has also been gaslit by the media with the persepctive you shared. It's a hundred something page document which trump did not write himself. It includes a number of topics, some of which are radical, and some of which are not. My point being, this isn't at all what the media is making it out to be, highlighting the radical lines in a huge document of *proposals.*\n\nAfter Trump stood up from the attempt on his life, he has solidified his place as an icon of American politics. There is no better man or woman for the ticket right now. And I've never been a huge fan of Trump, but I'm more politically charged than I ever have been right now, and I'm behind him.

And they're disinterested in learning. The liberals need to stop banging the fascist drum so hard and find a new topic. Don't be a one note campaign.\n\nThere are 4 groups of voters at this point:\n\n1. People who recognize that Trump and MAGA Republicans are authoritarian and admire fascism, which is bad for our country. Jan 6th terrified them. They believe Trump is a felon and a traitor. They are amazed Trump is still a candidate. Any negative Trump news is just preaching to this choir.\n\n2. People who fully drank the Trump koolaid and believe that what he has done is for the good of the country, fighting horrible liberal policies, like giving all our money and jobs to illegal immigrants, giving kids transgender surgeries and aborting full-term infants. The civil criminal charges are invalid (he's being attacked with false evidence because liberals are afraid of his policies) and Jan 6th was trying to save a crooked election. A lot of their news and information comes from social media bot farms and biased news sources. When they hear anything negative about Trump they have been trained to immediately suspect the information. You will not convince 99% of them with facts or labeling Trump as fascist. \n\nSome are proud of Trump. I have a Facebook acquaintance that is flying an American flag with pro-Trump words on top proudly proclaiming him as an \"outlaw\". Many are racist or totalitarian and agree with him although they'll probably deny if asked. They are motivated by hate, fear, and more \"showing the liberals\" than anything they actually believe in. \n\nOthers don't particularly like Trump but think he's the lesser of the evils. A lot of these are fixated on one issue. Abortion is evil and voting for anyone pro-choice is immoral. Illegal immigrants are the root of all evil in our country and border control is paramount, even if they live thousands of miles away from one. They should all be round up and deported (sounds like 1930's Germany to me).\n\n3. People who don't pay enough attention to the news. They have somehow not heard any of this. This is the only group that will be reached by attacks. But they have to be motivated to care enough to register and then to vote. But some just aren't afraid, but I don't like fear as a tool, like the Republicans overuse. \n\n4. People who don't care about politics at all one way or the other. Either they think all politicians are corrupt or they just prefer to remain disengaged. They're not registered to vote, they're not even listening.\n\nI just don't know what to think. I'm too exhausted to be anxious. I'm just voting and hoping.",

The right approves of more of the strong man approach to leadership. The left desires leaders who can be roll models, even if they can\u2019t project their own beliefs as strongly.\n\nTrump is by no means a good person. Some people within his base are misinformed about what he\u2019s done. Others are willfully ignorant, as they believe he can project power.\n\nAs for Kamala, she\u2019s someone who you can look up to. She won\u2019t be able to project power like Trump might be able to, but that\u2019s a difference in voting blocks.\n\nIf you clear the rhetoric of fascism, socialism, alt-right or the such, which many voters are oblivious to the meanings of each, they will choose who\u2019s best going to project, or agree with their own values in a leader.\n\nIt\u2019s far more complicated than this, but at its core, I\u2019ve seen family members who were previously anti-trump begin supporting him because they believe he is a strong leader. It isn\u2019t for a lack of knowing how bad he is as a person, but because they are fine putting that aside. And I want to make it clear that this isn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing, it\u2019s moreso a difference that is more pronounced among different people. Much of what I speak about now is anecdotal, so make your own observations about what the other side desires, and you will always be better informed.\n\nTo answer the question, calling Trump a fascist is just base pandering. It may get people to go and vote, but it may also galvanize right wingers to vote as well, and dissuade other groups of people who are tired of political rhetoric.",

The Democrats have effectively gained whatever advantage they are going to gain by calling Trump dangerous at this point.

I think calling Trump weird was a very good talking point in that it was somewhat novel. Voters who lived through 2016-2020 probably aren't changing their mind on how dangerous Trump but it did get them to start thinking hey Trump isn't funny or cool he's just weird and they should have stuck with that more.

He didn't arrest his critics or detesters. He didn't perform mass deportation. He didn't end ObamaCare. Even the biggest of the accusations surrounding Jan 6th is fairly weak since he didn't direct his followers to do anything (some will argue against this, but it's debatable at worst) and he didn't delay the election or inauguration of Joe Biden by even a single day. \n\nThe attacks also fall short due to Trump's opponents' hyper aggressiveness and exaggeration. It's a sort of \"Boy Who Cried Wolf\" effect on a country-wide (even global) scale. We've been told how terrible, fascist, evil, and Hitleresque Trump is non-stop for like 9 years now, we're desensitized to the accusations. They aren't impactful anymore, they don't give us pause or repulse us, because we've been hearing the same old stories for almost a decade. \n\nJust the other day I saw an article about a woman who claims Trump groped her on Epstein Island in like 1991, and how she's out here now telling her story, and how \"Blue Must Win\" and the first thing I ask is why this is conveniently released less than two weeks before the federal election. Why it wasn't released six months ago, or two years ago, or four years ago, or eight years ago, and frankly I doubt the authenticity of the claim due to that timing. Anyone with a real story to tell would have cashed in during 2016 or 2020. It's just odd. It's all odd. \n\nSo no, calling him a fascist doesn't do anything. It just makes the people using that attack seem out of touch and a little loony, prone to exaggeration. In a country with an actual, real, hardcore fascist leader (which they claim Trump was from 2016-2020), you ***would not be allowed*** to call him a fascist for fear of an unmarked van showing up at your home in the middle of the night, and large men dressed in all black and wearing balaclavas would force their way into your home, take you, and make you disappear.

Harris likely comes up on the short end here because of the fearmongering about the border but the Dem base still wanting people to be allowed to come in, so she will try a nuanced stance that won't go over as well while Trump will just say that he'll close the border which will be liked by many.\n\n* Questions about reproductive access and freedom that Trump will lie about and Harris will try to be aggressive about while also dodging any question about Walz's policy in Minnesota with no restrictions.  Harris comes out on top of this issue.\n\n* Questions about Israel/Palestine that Harris will try to thread the needle with nuance again that likely won't satisfy a lot of people because there is so much absolute, binary opinions on the issue.  Trump will lie and fearmonger bigly about it.\n\nFor an outcome for Harris I think it will help highlight how she is a relative breath of fresh air in getting away from the Biden-Trump dynamic which will help her a bit and perhaps help sway the low-info voters who don't pay much attention and don't know much about her.  However, if she stumbles in the debate then it could be somewhat damaging since the impression of her is still not strong amongst a lot of voters, and that would help cement a bad impression.  Her big danger is that the current and her future policies are nuanced trying to please people on both sides, but that doesn't play well since people want things to be more definitive and clear and so they will not be satisfied.\n\nAs an outcome for Trump I think he will just be the same old Trump BS'ing and lying and fearmongering his way through everything with no care for detail (\"I will close the border!\"  \"I will stop the war in Ukraine on day one!\"  \"I will fix the Israel situation on day one!\") and with his normal manic energy, but people are so used to it it won't change their opinion much of him...unless he comes across as really old compared to the relative youth of Harris.

That remains to be seen, but I can bet the GOP is praying really hard and sending all the thoughts and prayers that he will.",

He's unpredictable, brash and narcissistic. He'll never admit he's wrong, and that is both his strength and his weakness. To his supporters it's strength because our enemies can't figure him out either, and to his detractors he's dangerous because nobody can get through to him if he does something wrong. \n\nAs long as Donald J Trump is running in any campaign, it will essentially be all about him, like it or not.

I think that the GOP is forgetting the higher they make the pendulum swing, that it's also going to swing as much in the other direction.  And forcing women to have their periods, their pregnancies, their miscarriages - all very personal intimate details about their health to being REGISTERED?  \n\nWe also know this is not something that is being said for shock value or appeal to some voters.   U[nder Trump they DID this. They tracked periods to ensure that there weren't any abortions.](https://www.salon.com/2021/05/24/trump-aides-media-lawsuit-flops-after-report-he-dosed-mistress-with-abortion-pill_partner/)   In one case, there was a 17 year old migrant who was granted the right to have an abortion and then it was delayed - the Appellate judge who delayed it to try to run out the clock?  [Kavanaugh.](https://lawblogs.uc.edu/ihrlr/2019/05/10/garza-v-hargan-vacated-as-moot-but-still-hanging-over-the-judicial-system/) \n\nI thought the TRAP laws that shut down a lot of Planned Parenthood clinics was bad - this is absolutely terrifying.   Especially since the GOP doesn't really seem to understand science very well nonetheless women's reproductive parts.  \n\nThough this isn't Trump's ideology exactly,- this is his extremist supporters using him. The Christian Nationalists who believe MAGA is about forcing people into pretty generic, sterotyped roled families as if that's what happiness is.  Being forced into parenthood, forced into marriage because whatever it is they and the religious people like the Quiverfull believe and even have systemic methods of abusing women and children. (The Duggars belong to this Christian group, I believe. If not, the Christian extremism is about the same.)    But Basicallky there's a group of people out there who think government should be a theocracy.  That laws should be based on the morals or ethics of the reglious belief of one group.  They fail to understand that freedom of religion means freedom to practice and also freedom to be free of any one or all religions. \n\nTrump in 2016 even flip flopped on his stance on abortion 5 times in 3 days which included his famous comments about punishing women to Chris Matthews. \n\nANyway, at this rate, I almost feel like the MAGA GOP Train is at the point that it's \"Please, proceed\" so this crazy train can wreck itself.  Then I fear that if it's not contained on a level, then it's possible this demographic that has taken over the conventional GOP is going to get the White House again.   Simply Terrifying.",

So for the good of the country, and knowing that his hand picked VP is apt and capable of carrying the mantle forward, that he's not going to run for re-election.

People in their late 50s have experience, people in their 80s have irrelevant experience coupled with a myriad of potential health issues. It\u2019s always difficult to judge when someone is starts to be out of touch with newer generations, and to be fair to Biden I think he fought this far longer than most, but it isn\u2019t really possible to argue at this point that someone from Silent Generation can remotely relate to someone in Gen Z.\n3. Everything about Trumps incumbency in 2020 is unique and difficult to compare reasonably with past elections/outcomes and I\u2019m not saying this because Trump is such a unique fellow, but because the country was in the midst of unprecedented times with COVID.\n\n\nTo actually answer your question though I think the DNC and the democrat elite have really put themselves in a terrible spot. \n1. They lied to their constituents for at least a year in not having this discussion until Biden made it obvious in prime time that he is not the same person he was just 4 years ago.\n2. They are so late in the ballgame that it is not clear who or if anyone is in charge which has created incredible turmoil. \n3. Kamala Harris polls very poorly so the obvious choice for a replacement isn\u2019t so obvious.\n\nThis all brings me to the conclusion that they should probably keep Biden in the race, but encourage those in swing states with tough congressional races to distance themselves as much as necessary to still attempt a W. Either the polling is right and there is no path for a Dem victory regardless of candidate or the polling is wrong and Biden staying on the ticket reduces any self harm that could be caused by his removal.\n\nThe DNC has already lost a lot of trust, why would their base trust a no name candidate thrown at them out of the blue with less than 4 months to go.",

It makes NO SENSE to argue that he can't do the job when he is literally the only person currently doing the job.

Trump will be out of the picture and has no natural successor.

Anecdotally, I have experienced Gen Z warm up to her immensely over the last few months. The dramatic, fun PR angle can come from the VP selection, of which I think she has many great options (Mark Kelly, Andy BeShear, Roy Cooper, Josh Shapiro to name a few - I also think a Harris/Whitmer ticket could actually be very successful, but I doubt Whitmer has any interest).

He would have been a great one.\n\nAt this point this infighting is handing the election to the Republicans and it's fucking embarrassing because the Democrats always pull shit like this\n\nTrump is literally the fucking worst.   And the Democrats fight to make their current nominee bad with no actual backup plan.  I have no opinion of Kamala Harris because she hasn't been noteworthy as VP",

Yes, *generally* incumbents have an advantage. That doesn't mean that's always *100%* unchangeably true. Biden is old. So old as to be unprecedented. We've seen him fail to perform on a stage in front of the country. We all know he's only getting older. And we all have seen his failure to step up and bring energy and a clear message to the American public. These facts easily outweigh any advantages brought by incumbency itself. Biden is headed towards a loss and Democrats are making the correct decision in taking the gamble of swapping him out before it's too late. The American public has been very clear that they want a younger candidate and an option that isn't Biden or Trump. A fresh face right now is *exactly* what Americans want. Give that to them and the path to a win will open up. It's unwise to cling too tightly to conventional wisdom on these things lest you walk into a loss. That was exactly what happened in 2016 and the circumstances are looking scarily familiar this cycle, except now Democrats are giving this the weight it deserves.",

Well, they tend to tell us that what is good for business is the thing they think is good for their own personal business/wealth. And who most represents the interests of the ultra wealthy?

The frightening deficits of the Reagan years disappeared in the 1990s, partly because of sensible fiscal decisions taken by President George HW\u2009Bush. By the time Mr Clinton took office, the US economy was already recovering strongly. He was the lucky beneficiary of a surge in American productivity, following the transformation of the workplace by computers. With unemployment at just 4 per cent and inflation under control, there was exuberant talk of a \u201cNew Economy\u201d.

So this interviewer is going around asking Trump supporters if they have actually experienced any financial benefit from the Trump tax cut bill. They of course say yes. He goes on to prod them, \"can you give me a sense of how much it's helped, like how much have you saved because of it?\"\n\nSo several of these people go on to talk about how their household or their small business had this or that benefit, maybe this or that much less in taxes, some amounts being quite large and some numbers being quite specific.\n\nAnd of course then the shoe drops, the interviewer informs them that he knows they are lying because the Trump tax cuts were passed this year, but they don't go into effect until next year, it's literally impossible for them to have seen any benefit yet.\n\nAnd that's really how it works. It doesn't actually matter one iota what is true, it matters what your propaganda has convinced people to accept as true. These people probably weren't idiots.

There is no way anyone can say that he didn't truly love the country he served and as sad as it is to see him not try to go into the proverbial breech one last time it takes a certain humility to understand when it is time to step away.  He shepherded us from one of the most incompetent leaders we have ever had and helped at least for now restore America to its place on the world stage as being a leader that cares and an beacon for hope for millions around the world and turned around the country to the point of it now being in a better place then he came in economically, militarily, and healthier then what we were after the poor excuse for a human being that was before him.  And sorry I am not going to post a reply to this nor do I care if I hurt your feelings about Trump.  He is a worthless excuse for a human being and Biden was the antidote for that.",

Because, like Biden, the major reason (maybe the only reason) these people stepped down was because they knew for certain they were going to lose their reelection. Biden did not step down for the good of the nation, because he is too old, or because he is a true American patriot\u2014Biden is stepping down because he knows he will not win the next election and that is it. The proof is he and his inner circle resisted dropping out of the race for almost a month after the debate. He doesn\u2019t care about you, his legacy, what is best for America, or anything else. The only reason the collective tune started to change was because big donors started to withhold money. He was forced out, really.

This was supposed to be the final exclamation point of a long, but mostly unremarkable career.\n* He declined to run in 2016 because Hillary was considered a formidable candidate and he wanted to retire from public life.\n* After Trump's surprise win, and seeing the pure chaos and fascist tendencies of his administration, and the demoralized state of the Democrats after Hillary's defeat, he saw himself as the only one that could end the nightmare. So he came out of retirement and won, probably staving off the end of the American democracy.\n* His sense of honor and decency became his undoing (or nearly so, time will tell). He appointed an Attorney General in Merrick Garland that shared his values, and was thus slow to prosecute and investigate Trump's obvious crimes, for fear of looking as bad and vindictive as Trump.\n* The same sense of honor and decency led him to conclude he simply was too old to defeat Trump a second time and he bowed out of the race. It took some convincing, but he was wise enough to listen to advice, and stepped aside with the calculus that it gave America the best chance to save American democracy.\n\nAnd now we'll see. If Kamal wins, he threaded the needle, and Trump will die in jail (or house arrest). If not, then it was a valiant attempt, but ultimately it was a lost cause.",

It is, in a word, **HUGE**.\n\nLast year, on National Voter Registration Day, immediately following her post, saw traffic on [Vote.org](http://Vote.org) absolutely skyrocket...and that was in an off year election.\n\nIn her fan base, I am pretty sure, Harris was already the choice of the overwhelming amount of those intending to vote.  Taylor's endorsement though will almost certainly push some of those not intending to vote or not interested to get off their ass and register and vote.\n\nHer Instagram followers number about 280 million- of course, not all are US citizens, not all are 18 or older.  Even if we make a guess that just 20% of that number are people eligible to vote in the US, that's 56 million people.  If 15% of those are new voters and actually register and vote, that adds 8.4 million people to the vote tally.  If 75% of them vote for Harris, that's 6.3 million more votes- that's over 7.5% of Biden's total 2020 vote.  \n\nNow, the big question is how are those 6.3 million votes distributed around the country?  If they were all in New York or California, they almost wouldn't matter.  Of course that isn't the case.  But when you look at how close the margins were in some states in 2020, it could easily matter.  In Georgia where Biden won by about 11,400 votes.  Imagine this year's vote is identical, but now add just 20,000 \"Swift vote\"- suddenly the margin of victory has tripled.  \n\nThen there is another impact- all those fans who can't vote. Just because a 16 year old Swiftie can't register and vote, doesn't mean they can't help the campaign by making phone calls, helping in field offices, knocking on doors (yes, with someone older).  \n\nFinally, she has more concerts coming up:  Three in Miami; three in New Orleans; and three in Indianapolis.   Imagine Harris walks out on stage during one of the Miami dates?  It could move the needle in Florida where people are seriously just pissed off at Republicans (insurance costs, DeSantis's insanity, etc).   I doubt she can do anything in Louisiana.  Indiana is a question mark- the state is very red overall but it did vote for Obama in 2008 (before that you have go back to 1964).  I think that depends how much further off the rails Trump goes.  \n\nIn any event, she definitely has the power to make a difference in a close race.",

If we\u2019re requiring someone to go through one extreme medical procedure to save a life, we should require the other. If the consent of one person to participate isn\u2019t required, then the same should go for the other\n\nIn addition, some babies are in need of organs. By his logic, if it saves lives (and our surgical skills are enough to operate on babies), we should be legally required to take the unnecessary organs from one to give to another, with neither the baby\u2019s nor the mother\u2019s consent.

The fetus/baby has roughly the same level of brain activity and self-awareness. Yes the moral obligation to the mother changes pretty dramatically. That's why the exception exists.

Or if the pregnancy endangers the health / life of the mother.\n\nWhy do I phrase it that way? Because not all pregnancies are viable. No one should be forced to risk their life over a non viable potential life. A dead person can't try again later if they want to.\n\nBecause there are no circumstances outside pregnancy where we attempt to force people to use their bodies to keep someone else alive. If you had the only blood that could save a person from a form of cancer, and it took nine months of donations, no one can force you to donate blood and save that person's life. No one can force you to donate an organ, even if you are the only match. \n\nAnd no one should force a person into creating life when they don't want to, and then hoping that said new life can be donated or sold to a better family before there is biological-emotional attachment like parents get, it the kid becomes a less popular age to adopt. \n\nNo one should be \"punished\" for having sex, or having been coerced, threatened, or overpowered. No one should be forced to create children out of fear of birth rates going down. \n\nI also believe in contraceptive freedom including the right to safely be sterilized (vasectomy or tying the tubes, etc).\n\nEvery person deserves their self determination.\n\nI think this will increase polarization in the cases where folk were on the fence with their votes, but that's very few voters right now.",

And the more \u201cTrump chose wrong\u201d ideas are floating around is going to cause Trump himself to become more defensive, more unpredictable, and potentially more closed off from other high-end GOP allies and advisors.

Nowhere does the bible equate murder with abortion, even though abortion was around long before then. And abortion was around before the 70's but it wasn't controversial in christianity. \n\nChristians are taught that the bible says god knows us in the womb but that was a specific reference to a biblical character and god in the bible exists outside of time. That only means that god can know someone before birth and who they will become. It does not mean that a fetus is a human anymore than a dead person or every person yet to be born is a human.",

If you actually believe the logic behind the anti-abortion movement as stated by its proponents, the conclusion that exceptions for rape and incest shouldn't be made is the inevitable conclusion. If you really see abortion as the murder of babies, you can't go around murdering them for things like that that were not their fault. \n\nIt seems to me that the ecosystem of the anti-abortion movement has two main factions: the true believers like Vance, and the responsibility crowd. The true believers are fully on board with what he's saying for the reasons I stated above. The responsibility crowd see this more as a personal responsibility issue, where you shouldn't do the dirty unless you're ready for the consequences. They are often also swayed by the abortion = baby murder argument, but will usually fall back to the personal responsibility angle when the morality starts getting murky. Note that the exceptions here generally are things that are out of the pregnant person's control.\n\nSo the true believers will often compromise their values with the inclusion of exceptions in order to get the personal responsibility crowd on board without appearing too cruel. The calculation here is that blocking most abortions is better to them than blocking none and they need the extra support. The exceptions also make them seem more moderate to fence sitters who are undecided on the issue, whereas the more hardline stance might radicalize some of those people against them.\n\nIn terms of how this affects the election, I think it's a really bad move for the Trump campaign. It's debatable weather abortion being on the ballot actually changes the outcome of elections towards Democrats, but it sure doesn't help Republicans. They may even run the risk of demotivating the responsibility crowd who are a huge part of the voter pool that this issue drives. I don't think Vance knows or cares quite how small the true believer block is, or how much heat that stance can generate from people who are otherwise indifferent to the issue.",

While in the short term decreasing regulations and taxes help the rich, in the long term it helps average people to be able to compete with the big guys. Contrary to popular belief, many regulations and taxes are used to protect mega corporations. Almost all of them are well beyond the threshold of diseconomies of scale and cannot survive in an economy that can out perform them. A famous example of such regulatory protectionism is the destruction of the hemp industry to protect the wood industry. While the average cost to start a business is 30k-40k. The average employee costs for the businesses range around $41.03 to $43.26 per hour with a fraction of that actually being the employees income. \n\nThen there is the excess spending problem created by our national debt burden. In Germany prior to ww2, in order to pay the striking workers the government simply printed more money. This flood of money led to hyperinflation as the more money was printed, the more prices rose. Prices ran out of control, for example a loaf of bread, which cost 250 marks in January 1923, had risen to 200,000 million marks in November 1923. The dollar on the other hand is a world reserve currency so we are affected a lot less, but we are getting to that point very fast now.\n\nThese two major factors are the primary factors which allows the rich owning everything. Most of the economic problems are in the financial sector who benefit most from debt burden these above issues create. This is why the same issues happened in 2008 with banks creating housing bubbles.",

        "body": "This is one of those, \"it's complicated\" situations, but the short answer is \"yes, absolutely.\" \n\nTo really help with housing affordability there are going to have to be more fundamental changes in the system that will require very complex solutions and likely varying solutions depending on the local situation. I have some insight as my family owns real estate in my area and we know some of the smaller, and larger, companies that are competition quite well. Most of what we own is commercial, but we have enough residential to see some of the different local challenges.\n\nIt is different in the two areas we have property. Both areas are within 1 hour of each other so that is why it is so important that local authorities are the ones looking at what is happening and implementing the solutions at the local level.\n\nIn area 1, it is a case of supply limitations primarily from large corporations. The two main ones are subsidiaries of Greystar and another company that is primarily owned by Warren Buffett. I cannot find the name of Buffett's company. Both are publicly traded companies that at the top are LLCs that are effectively giant holding companies with piles of subsidiaries that own billions of dollars in housing. Mainly apartment complexes that they bought up starting in the late 90s. Historically the way these companies worked was they wanted a low vacancy rate so the properties were maximizing the value individually. During the housing crisis when demand went through the roof for apartments, they realized that minimizing vacancies wasn't the best approach and instead paid very smart analysts to figure out what level of vacancy maximized profit per unit. Part of this led to discovering that at 75% occupancy, they cut costs in maintenance and drove up the market price of their individual properties which made them more profitable. Since apartment complexes do cycle at a fairly steady rate, it's difficult to notice that 1 in 4 apartments are empty all the time because of course they are! If one sits for a couple months because it isn't back on the available list, no one notices and the company makes more money. There are not a significant number of empty single family homes in this area because there are city and county ordinances that make it more expensive to keep them unoccupied for a long period including some aggressive squatters rights laws. It is better to have someone you know is paying rent and that are responsible for simple maintenance on the yard and around the home. The market for single family homes is also so strong that in multiple cases, the company is selling some of the single family properties because the ROI is extremely high right now.\n\nIn area 2, demand is extremely high to the point that leaving something unoccupied makes no sense. One property will draw 20+ applicants every day. In this area, there are very few multi-family properties as well so having a lower occupancy doesn't make sense since it is easy to spot unoccupied properties. Unoccupied properties will potentially be damaged and the fastest and easiest way to prevent that is to pick one of the hundreds of options you have. \n\nArea 1 needs some kind of occupancy regulations added to it. If properties were required to offer out all vacant properties within 30 days of becoming vacant it would drive pricing down rapidly as there are thousands of unoccupied properties in the area. The area limits competition artificially and if competition were returned then pricing would improve. \n\nArea 2 needs expanded connectivity to the surrounding areas. It is within a major metropolitan area and it is one of the ones in the US that has good public transit, but there is a very clear ring where that transit is worse outside of the ring. Adding more ways to get inside the ring (which is actually happening) will expand where people are willing to live as a significant part of the population in this area live there to be close to the higher paying jobs that are available and use that public transit. \n\nThese are my two examples that I am aware of and see what local authorities have done (the public transit is directly in response to housing costs). Oddly, area 2 likely will become more like area 1 as the transit options become better and we may need to look at some kind of mixed approach when it does improve.",

It's the way the Republican Party has yielded  any accountability to the Constitution and the way the President is an essential part of the checks and balances in this country.  That's what makes America America.    Trump sees the Presidency the same way he sees the President of a Company.  \"He's the boss and he's in charge and he's the one with the power.\"  It's not the same thing at all.   He also treats it the way he treats his own company with his children lined up behind him being given power positions in the US Government.   Think of any other president that has ever crossed THAT line?  On either side?  Their children given power positions in Government?\n\nThe real problem here IMO is how few 30 -40 year olds,  really understand how problematic it is.  Mostly because they are the ones who have taken the brunt of financial crisis that really started in 2008 with the housing bubble burst.   It was the beginning of the end in some ways as far as being able to get the American dream.    As far as they are concerned \"everything was better economically\".    But it had nothing to do with TRUMP.   The House and Senate were both majority Republican.\n\nRepublican policies are often  IMO fiscally conservative and can make middle class Americans feel like they are making progress,  building assets and taking care of their families.   For some people that's way more important than social justice.\n\nI can vote either way.   But Trump is not a representative of American Republicans IMO   He's a representative of Trump incorporated.    That's way too close to a dictatorship at the worst and at the very least a complete sabotage and refusal of American Representative Democracy.   If that gets tipped over,  it's very unlikely that it will right itself again within a Presidential term,.  It will drag on and on.

Frankly the issue is the media, which goes on a weeks-long open campaign to destroy Joe Biden\u2019s campaign but refuses to treat the threat to democracy with the same level of prominence \u2014 much less a comparably appropriate level of importance. \n\nRemember how in the first few days of his presidency, Trump installed a version of a Muslim ban, leading to massive protests at airports, and then lawsuits that stopped the ban because Trump wasn\u2019t competent enough and didn\u2019t have the courts on his side enough to power through? \n\nNow imagine a similar thing happening early in the Trump presidency. He embarks on a massive deportation campaign, centered on arresting immigrants, holding them in camps, and deporting them. Massive protests and lawsuits ensue. The lawsuits go nowhere because the courts are in Trump\u2019s pocket. The protests are met with violent police crackdowns. The media calls the violence riots, blaming the protestors. Trunk invokes the insurrection act, sending the military to crack heads. Protestors are killed. Anyone in the Trump administration who objects is fired due to Schedule F. The few remaining people are full on authoritarian true believers. In the immigration camps, there aren\u2019t enough judges to process the cases, and many who do don\u2019t process them fairly. Immigrants start dying of heat or cold or medical neglect in the camps. The media tries to report on them and Trump shuts them down for national security reasons. The media sue in the courts and the courts take the administration\u2019s side. And so forth\u2026\n\nThis scenario has resulted in the effective end of the first amendment, a military rule over American cities, and mass suffering to both immigrants and citizens. Nothing about this scenario is remotely far fetched \u2014 Trump has openly bragged about ending Schedule F, invoking Insurrection Act, and being a dictator on day one, while the courts have given him total immunity for any crime and have approved the unitary executive theory. Instead of far-fetched, this is all openly planned; moreover, it only touches on one aspect of Trump\u2019s agenda (immigration) without discussing the ripple effects of these actions in the rest of the country or any of his other priorities as shown in Project 2025. \n\nAnd yet would any neutral viewer of the mainstream media think that this is plausible or even possible?

Media bubbles and the insulation of information: I'm not a right winger and don't consume right-wing news, but I associate with people who do, and when they start talking about news and current events it feels like we live in two different sets of reality. Like they have concerns and use language that I'm not even familiar with.

Like in a lot of failed states, the trains still run and restaurants are still open and kids still play on playgrounds, so you wouldn't know from looking at it.

The slow drip - as often quoted in that Milton Mayer piece (that should be required reading):\n\n*To live in this process is absolutely not to be able to notice it\u2014please try to believe me\u2014unless one has a much greater degree of political awareness, acuity, than most of us had ever had occasion to develop. Each step was so small, so inconsequential, so well explained or, on occasion, \u2018regretted,\u2019 that, unless one were detached from the whole process from the beginning, unless one understood what the whole thing was in principle, what all these \u2018little measures\u2019 that no \u2018patriotic German\u2019 could resent must some day lead to, one no more saw it developing from day to day than a farmer in his field sees the corn growing. One day it is over his head.*\n\n5. Plus I'm sure a bunch of other stuff I haven't mentioned.",

Based on his first term and the things he's been saying over the last year and a half, Trump being reelected could potentially lead to World War 3.  How can I justify such an extreme claim?\n\n1. According to his defense secretary, he wanted to fire missiles into Mexico and deny that the USA did it (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ya5njPBoXMg).  Now, Trump has been advocating for military action against Mexico (https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/trump-mexico-kill-teams-drug-cartels-1235016514/ ; [https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/4204556-trump-downplays-prospect-of-war-with-mexico-over-fight-against-cartels/](https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/4204556-trump-downplays-prospect-of-war-with-mexico-over-fight-against-cartels/) ; https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/dictator-trump-troops-border-1234929369/), and even said a few months ago that he predicts Mexico will soon be obliterated in a nuclear attack in WW3 (https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-mexico-destroyed-nuclear-weapons-war-1842810).\n2. According to the head of the joint chiefs of staff, Trump, at the advisory of Netanyahu, wanted to start a war with Iran after he lost the election over their nuclear program.  This led Milley to tell Trump \"if you do this, you're going to have a fucking war\", and Milley described the situation as analogous to Hitler's reichstag fire (https://www.newyorker.com/news/letter-from-bidens-washington/youre-gonna-have-a-fucking-war-mark-milleys-fight-to-stop-trump-from-striking-iran).  This whole issue is clearly still important to Trump, considering that among the classified documents he stole were his war plans to invade Iran (https://www.cnn.com/2023/06/26/politics/trump-classified-documents-audio/index.html).\n3. Trump wanted to nuke North Korea and blame it on another country (https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-discussed-using-nuclear-weapon-north-korea-2017-blaming-someone-rcna65120#).  This scared the hell out of the defense secretary (https://theweek.com/speedreads/936838/north-korea-close-nuclear-war-mattis-frequently-prayed-church-woodward-says) and the homeland security departments (https://www.politico.com/news/2023/07/10/anonymous-author-trump-nuclear-meetings-00105366), and Trump didn't seem to care at all about the devastation that would follow.  They were only able to convince him not to do it by manipulating his narcissism and telling him that everyone would love him for preventing WW3.\n4. Trump has said over 100 times in the last year and a half that, because Joe Biden is the most corrupt and incompetent president in American history, because his whole family is a crime family that is consumed by greed, because Biden is a madman and a mental catastrophe and a stark raving lunatic, because Biden is a fascist dictator and threat to democracy who's trying to overthrow the US government, because he's a compromised president and a Manchurian candidate who is being blackmailed by Russia and China, because Joe Biden clearly has all of these horrible qualities, Joe Biden is going to cause WW3 and a.nuclear holocaust if he's reelected.  And Trump?  Trump is literally the messiah, the second coming of God and the King of Israel, the Chosen One.  Only Trump can save the world from the total obliteration that will definitely soon happen if Biden is reelected.  How in the fuck can anyone who is familiar with the first three points I made, and with Trump in general, seriously argue that this last paragraph isn't 100% pure projection?  (Let me know if you want links to these.  There are SO many clips of him saying this stuff that it's hard to choose what to cite)\n\nNone of this is fear mongering, these are thorny facts that cannot be ignored.  If Trump is reelected, there is zero chance, ZERO, that he doesn't try to pull this shit again.  He is telling us through his projection what he's going to do.  \"You knew damn well I was a snake before you took me in!\"\n\nEDIT: at least one commentator made the point that my sources are likely to be perceived as biased, and hence invalid.  One source is a video the former Defense Secretary talking about the Mexico situation.  Another is in reference to a video Univision interview where Trump said Mexico would be obliterated in nuclear war soon.  Another is in reference to a video interview Trump had with Megyn Kelly, where he said he wanted military action against Mexico.  Another source is a video of Trump bragging about having stolen his war plans to invade Iran and trying to reframe it as Milley's war and not his.  Another source is from a journalist who is generally considered credible and won the Pulitzer Prize for his reporting on Trump.  Another is from Bob Woodward, who has a long history of credible reporting.  And lastly, I didn't cite sources for Trump's repeated claims that Biden would cause a nuclear holocaust, mostly because there are too many to count.  There are tons of videos on YouTube of Trump saying exactly this.\n\nif you bothered to check my sources, you'd realize that these are credible facts, rather than biased sensationalist opinion pieces.",

Democracy no longer suits their goals of religious beliefs turned into law, white dominance and authority to force this on the rest of us. The conspirators have fooled the religious community into believing that they will provide them with this control. Trump doesn\u2019t give a shit about religion but he does need the religious vote to have a chance. Once he attains control of the government and the military, it will be nearly impossible to get it back just like it is in Russia or China. Most of the trailer park attendees of Trumps rallies were lucky to get out of high school. They have no idea what will actually happen if Trump gains power, but they love the aggressive hate and threats of violence in putting down the groups they know provoke an emotional response such as Blacks, Hispanics, gays and women. Fox News spends hours everyday pounding this into their heads until they reach the point of physical violence as a means of achieving their view of a Eutopian all white, religious paradise where these demons have been destroyed.

People don't call for Trump to drop out because he's a narcissist with who demonstrably cannot handle loss. Meanwhile, the people who call for Biden to drop out do so because they believe there is a chance he'd want to put the county first and actually entertain the idea of self sacrifice if he were convinced that was the way to beat Trump.\n\nThat said, it's kind of silly to use this angle to suggest people are more okay with trump being in the race than biden. Trump faced a much more aggressive primary, multiple impeachments and has for years been the subject of reporting about how problematic he is. Some of that reporting has even led to criminal lawsuits with many hoping he is imprisoned. So yes, people gave up on literally asking the narcissist to give up, but it's unreasonable to frame it as though that suggests Biden is the only one people want and try to get out of the race. People are just using different tactics based on what they perceive as possibly effective. \n\nIt's also worth noting that it's the way biden and trump engage with people that invites this different response. Trump told his own voters in a rally that he doesn't need them and famously will ostracize any critics. So the many people who did appeal to Trump are cast off and few people see a value in doing so. Meanwhile, Biden doesn't take this approach and I think it creates a sense in voters that they can criticize Biden and still have a voice in the party.",

        "body": "Two differences:\n\nThe liberal community also wants him to step down. He wasn't as widely received as the Democrat party would have you believe in the first place, he was popular solely for not being Trump. A long of Democrat voters feels he was \"good enough\" in the relative times, not particularly good.  For those that did think he was good, nobody particularly found him great. So when he suddenly shows he has bad mental health, which is a very big deal, it was inevitable his support turns on him both in his social elite and the voters. \n\n\nThe Republican party has no candidates that are widely received as good. The one exception is Trump, of course. While many Republicans don't necessarily want Trump and think it's time to move on, nobody stepped up to be a viable choice. There's Jeb Bush, the guy we will likely never see again because he's a weak public speaker. There's Ron Desantis, the guy already revealed to be weaker in support from the voters than Trump. There's Ted Cruz, someone that's just not very good at public speaking and comes off as a cringe idiot even to his own supporters at times. That's it. Plenty of Republicans will disagree which of these current likelys are best. We absolutely wont see these three run again, maybe Desantis but he honestly shouldn't (lol). So Trump is not only the best candidate for getting support, he is also currently the only choice. Republicans are naturally more invested in politics, they assert an energy unlike Democrats on the account they are nationalists or are a variant patriotic branch from it., so the feedback is gonna be hard to ignore which gets the needed energy to possibly win an election. I think you will not see any real candidate until Trump is 100% out of the picture because individuals like Desantis has a tainted public image just from Trump's big mouth. \n\n\nThe other issues are the following; Trump's mental health is as apparent as Biden's when he first started his presidency. An old man stuttering or being sloppy isn't as alarming as symptoms of Alzheimer.   We will forgive someone being so old they cannot walk up the stairs alone, but not someone that has no decent human function due to it not being his nap time. In spite being about two years apart in age, Trump is significantly healither mentally than Biden.  \n\n\nAs for being a convicted felon, the only people that keeps beating that dead horse is the liberal community. Majority of people don't care or don't understand the significance of the crimes, it seems like he got his hand caught in the cookie jar rather than being a special case of truly being guilty of something terrible. Unlike previous presidents, Trump caters to an anti \"shadow government\" demographic, and people that believes in the shadow government also believes the shadow government has been doing far worse for far longer. Be honest, who is worse to you, someone guilty of rigging an election like everyone else and mishandling sensitive information (selling it), or someone doing all of this since Kennedy presidency but also fucking kids, rigging the economical climate, controlling monopolies and maintaining them, etc. The fact of the matter is, no matter how bad you portray Trump, he seems like a necessary evil compared to who you stand against. Majority of people, including liberals, don't fully understand what Trump did and its significance, and those that do might not care either. Just like how liberals often overlook the Clintons, to the point of giving Hilary unjustified support and tries to cry misogyny for why one might hate her, in spite her husband being good friends with a convicted child trafficker, and in spite the implications behind the emails, which only liberals downplay because the same reasons of \"well the other guys are doing worse so\", Trump will never be antagonize by his own base. There are a lot of liberals that don't approve of Hilary but will vote her anyway because she isn't a Republican, you're going to see that a lot too with Trump. There is, too, the issue of both parties making the mistake of antagonizing and labeling the voters solely for who they're voting as things they're not. Both parties. Trump supporters are magically racist, even if they have reasons unrelated to race, and the energy put into antagonizing them for something they know they're not causes them to have no interest hearing the other side's arguments for why their candidate should step down. You're being an unreasonable witch hunter, what's the odds you have reasonable arguments? If you had reasonable arguments for why Trump should step down, surely that would be the focus instead of being labeled a racist for being against illegal immigration, or even voters that don't care about that shit (half of people I meet don't care, they don't pretend they understand how it's important one way or another). People will pretend they absolutely try to raise awareness to their reasonable arguments against the other group's president, but they always handle politics poorly as a yelling match instead very quickly the moment they realizing their word for it isn't enough. No matter how much people will argue for why Trump will step down, that's simply not reaching or being processed by the die hard supporters, and the majority of supporters, whether reluctantly or not, also don't understand and never will someone reasonable explain why or, even more important, provide better options. Yes, always, when people tell you you're choice in politics is wrong, never do they provide a better option, they just want you to vote for the guy THEY like, not someone that's a fit for you. \n\n\nDone taking a shit, not gonna ramble anymore",

My understanding is that republicans vaguely see them as him getting caught covering up an affair and got caught up in a bunch of paperwork crimes that are really hard for republicans to get angry about, as they don't tend to like rules and regulations as is. Not a great look, but Trump is known to be kinda sleazy, so an affair was already baked in.\n\nThe other is how much respect you have for the institution handing them out.

The narrative goes, it is big corporations and landlords bad behavior.\n\nBut corporations are made up by say 50K middle class workers, while the decisions are made by 50 rich executives that hide behind the company.  The govt will penalize the company hurting the 50K, but not the 50.\n\nAlso, will they be able to distinguish between the mom and pop landlords collecting rent to live in retirement vs. the big corporate/capitalist driving up prices as an investment?   And if you think the Democratic party is going to take on these capitalists you should remember that the tax rate on salaries is so much higher than Capital Gains.  It is really not very progressive. Both parties dont want to address that they are in the pockets of the rich.",

        "body": "The food prices thing won't work. Will just lead to scarcity. Though admittedly doing something like that was also my initial thought for food, medicine, and gas prices. But [according to economists](http://www.econlib.org/library/Enc/PriceControls.html) it can lead to disastrous results (tldr: it's scarcity).\n\nI originally thought regarding food and gas prices that it was \"inflation when there's little to no reason.\" Record profits, and just corporate greed. The issue is I simply did not understand those reasons. Which has to do with how profits are reported by reporters, which is inherently flawed. More on that in a moment.\n\nShrinkflation (reducing quantity, maintaining price) and skimpflation (reducing quality, maintaining price) are deceptive practices that are possible simply because it's allowed. Those practices can be made illegal and that will \"solve\" that issue. But not the underlying cause, or inflation. It seems those happen due to competition and increasing price would make a product less favorable compared to others without an increased price.\n\nIn terms of something like perceived price gouging by oil, I've come to [understand](https://www.steverrobbins.com/articles/oilprofitsexplained/) it's not so simple as it's based on profit margin in form of percent rather than raw dollar profits. For instance if gas were $2 with 25% profit margins instead of gas going up 50 cents when oil prices go up 50 cents, keeping profit margin constant means gas prices will raise 67 cents when oil prices go up 50 cents. That extra 17 cents flows straight to the bottom line. In dollar terms, profits formerly at $.50 are now at $.67. Though markets may inherently be a bad mechanism for something like oil. So pricing becomes based at best on marginal cost to produce, rather than on anything relative to the actual value to society. The simplification of this is that although looking at the raw dollars it looks like \"record profits\" but if you look at it as percentage profit margins it simply isn't, as much as we'd like to demonize big oil - and they should be, this just isn't why. \n\nSo why are we even talking about oil? According to the book \u201cThe Omnivore\u2019s Dilemma,\u201d **about 1/3 of the world\u2019s population only gets fed because we have genetically modified corn that requires special petroleum-based fertilizer**. The market price of oil (to the extent that it\u2019s a market and not simply OPEC\u2019s arbitrarily-set price) doesn\u2019t include any component that has to do with the future of the world\u2019s food supply. Most (all?) market players just don\u2019t know enough about the full supply chain of which oil is a part to price it properly. So the government [should step in](https://www.steverrobbins.com/articles/what-problems-are-markets-the-answer-to/) in that case.\n\nIt seems to me [many of the current issues](https://www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/2023/beyond-bls/what-caused-inflation-to-spike-after-2020.htm) are inherently tied to inflation as a whole. As the labor market tightened during 2021 and 2022, core inflation rose as the ratio of job vacancies to unemployment increased. This ratio is used to measure wage pressures that then pass through to the prices for goods and services. As workers bargain for better pay, firms begin to increase prices. Three main components explain the rise in inflation since 2020: volatility of energy prices, backlogs of work orders for goods and service caused by supply chain issues due to COVID-19, and price changes in the auto-related industries.\n\nSo shrinkflation/skimpflation: just illegalize it as it's a deceptive practice. This is also inherently addressing a symptom rather than the cause. So, the cause. Those three main components. How do we address that instead? Assuming that is indeed the root cause alleviating it should theoretically solve the symptomatic problems observed at the result of its effects.\n\nSo...\n\nEnergy price volatility:\n\n* Reduce dependency on oil by increased investing in renewable energy sources, or otherwise diversification of energy sources like nuclear (LFTR), fusion (theoretical tbh), and so on.\n* Use strategic petroleum reserves and increase drilling temporarily while shifting away from petroleum for energy.\n\nBacklogs of work orders for goods and service caused by supply chain issues due to COVID-19:\n\nI don't know. Utilize DPA (Defense Production Act) to help the affected industries recover?\n\nPrice changes in the auto-related industries:\n\nI know nothing about this.\n\nJob vacancies and unemployment increasing:\n\n* Cut down on frivolous requirements for employment that aren't necessary by regulation, like college degrees and years of experience for entry level positions that don't require it.\n* Increase automation. Introduce UBI to compensate, which will likely require a VAT though some other taxes would need to be removed to compensate for that.\n* Adjust immigration to address specific labor shortages.\n\nFor price setting it may be worthwhile to reduce the influence of monopolistic market structures and break up large firms and/or encourage increased competition.\n\nMandating social and environmental costs in pricing mechanisms can help considerations regarding long-term impacts on society.\n\nSet up preparations to respond to external shocks like pandemics to prevent this sorta thing in the future.\n\nIn short, the food bit, not great. Probably good for getting support, not so much for actual policy.",

This has trickled through the economy and  affected everything from food to goods to home building resulting in inflation and greedflation. It would take about six years to readjust after addressing and regulating this issue (prices go up quickly, down slowly, and the results take a longer time to affect each of the industries from shipping to building).  This is step 1 of a functional plan.  \nStep 2 would involve regulating companies that make massive profits ($100,000,000 or more) in a way that prevents them from paying any single employee (including compensation) ten or more times as much as any other employee including contractors on or offshore. This would result in removal of CEO salaries that dwarf the average worker's salary (most are making in the tens of millions). and higher wages for all workers and more jobs.  \nStep 3 would be to address the home prices by investing in modular home building (not manufactured or trailers, research the difference). Modular is more efficient construction that can deliver an offsite built, higher quality (modular homes are built inside factories that prevent weather and other site building delays to interfere with delivery dates) products at lower prices in general.   \nLastly, an 80% tax on anyone making $500,000 a year or more. If you are scraping by making half a million a year, you need counselling and can afford it. The majority of the middle class makes less than $80,000 a year and cannot afford to buy the average house today and many still have no emergency savings, and retirement savings. This would help more than a tax credit for the fewer and fewer people having children. This would also be better than her assistance program for the very few trying to buy a home.   \nOf course this is in stark contrast to the Trump \"Just give all your money to the very wealthy and they will take care of you\" economic \"plan\".

        "body": "Let me preface my opinion by declaring my POV: I'm absolutely 100% voting for her even though I'm a Republican, because Donald Trump is an existential threat to this country. \n\nThat said, like most Democratic policy, these ideas look very well-intentioned, but very short-sighted. Let's take the food prices idea first. Montana is one of the largest wheat producing states in the country. Like many states, it has tied its minimum wage inextricably to cost of living adjustment calculations. That will increase the overhead costs for harvesting, transporting and baking wheat, which, in turn, will increase the cost of bread. Will those overhead costs be taken into account when capping the increases in bread pricing? \n\nIf yes, then the policy will look fairly ineffectual, because that's the biggest driver of increasing bread prices. The Harris-Walz Administration looks ineffectual. \n\nIf no, then what happens when the cost of producing bread exceeds the amount that it can be sold for? *People stop making bread.* Hopefully everyone understands the obvious problem with that.  \n\nThat's assuming the policy figures out some kind of raw percentage based on averages. Remember, the system's a lot more complicated than that - different retailers buying their bread from different sources, that are in turn buying the wheat to make it from a wide range of suppliers at varied prices. So with a flat rate raw percentage, the people who've been selling their wheat for more - likely justifying it as higher quality - drop out of business first because everyone's running for the cheap shit. The pattern of everything getting worse because of this continues. \n\nTax and medical cost proposals have similar concerns to them. The only way those things are viable in the long run is raising taxes. And that's fine if that's what has to be done, but remember, the stated goal is for people to feel *less* financially crushed. Lower drug costs is higher insurance costs, which for those people getting their health insurance on the marketplace probably means greater government subsidies for their care, which means more government spending, which means... tax increases. It's all just a complicated way of shuffling the bill from one spot to another, mostly by creating regulations that might not be flexible enough to meet a changing world. (A simple example of that involves criminal history and labor shortages. We're low on workers and there are a lot of criminal history disqualifications that don't make a ton of sense - what danger is someone who embezzled banking info if they work at a day care, and what danger is the sex offender working out of the home as a telephone-based customer service rep? But government bans on hiring weren't written with that kind of nuance in mind, because the government didn't see the day coming when we'd be desperate to put butts in chairs and keep the whole structure from total collapse. These newly proposed regulations have the potential to tie our hands similarly for almost no real benefit.)\n\nThe housing construction idea is largely a good one, but this is another example of past Democratic administrations tying our hands - the regulations for home purchasing credit scores and debt-to-income ratios never took into account the idea that *the entire country* could take a hit from a sustained lockdown, yet no one's taken any steps to lower the bar. I'm also kinda shocked the Democrats are endorsing tearing up the environment like that. :) That's kinda their equivalent of the GOP endorsing an adulterer. \n\nWhich brings us to the last proposal, and undeniably the best - the child tax credit. No way around it, we need more people. More people is more workers and taxpayers. Anything we can do to incentivize people having more kids is essential to our long-term survival. \n\nThe only caveat is that we also still kinda need the revenue, though. I'm eager to hear where she plans to divert the money to pay for the tax credit. If this were any other year, I'd say something ***very*** unRepublican and suggest downsizing the military, because we could cut that budget by a third and still be leading the world in military capability. But that would cause morale issues and require the military to adjust to less resources at a time when different doomsday scenarios are not just coming to our doors, but standing on the stoop and smashing the doorbell incessantly like psychotic girl scouts trying to make quota. We can't even think about doing that until Putin's off the table and we're done flirting with the possibility of Civil War 2.0. So... fucked if I know where the money's coming from. We might start having to make really hard choices. That's why some red states have started flirting with the idea of loosening child labor laws to get them over the hump until the boomers finish retiring and our millennials start driving capital costs back down. \n\nAnyway, end of rant. If you dislike something said enough to downvote it, that's fine, all I ask it that you put your words where your clicks are and actually make a counterargument.",

But she has several plans to increase housing supply too, which is good.\n\nAs far as her plans to deal with groceries I support the idea of laws against price gouging, but isn't a big part of why grocery prices are so high due to damage to manufacturing and supply chains as a result of Covid-19? Someone correct me if I'm wrong, I thought we were still recovering from that.\n\nBut I've also heard (not sure if its true) that we have recovered from that, but food providers are just using that as an excuse to drive up profits with higher prices.\n\nEither way, none of this will get through congress. Even if the democrats did win both the house and the senate (they probably won't IMO) the democrats will conveniently forget to pass all this stuff, the same way they were able to get the employee free choice act passed through congress when they knew Bush would veto it, but once Obama had 59 senators and the house, all of a sudden the democrats couldn't get it passed through congress anymore.\n\nI vote democrat, but the democratic party is walking a tightrope between keeping their voters happy and keeping wealthy special interests happy. A lot of these laws will make wealthy special interests unhappy. So I think this is all just meaningless programs the democrats either know they'll never actually implement, or if they do have the power to do so, they won't actually implement.\n\nSmall donors are rapidly growing as a % of the financial support politicians get. I am hoping if that trend continues, democrats will be more willing to enact laws that actually take on the wealthy interests that control congress because they will be freed from financial control by them.\n\nOn the subject of homeowners, homeowners in their own way are special interests. Homeowners have more money, they have better educations, and they are more likely to vote than renters.\n\nHomeowners want housing prices high by keeping demand high and supply low because that benefits them. Reducing demand and/or increasing supply will hurt homeowners financially.\n\nSo despite Harris talking about addressing high home prices, I think shes just scamming us with false promises. The democrats aren't going to pass laws that piss off tens of millions of voters with good incomes.\n\nIf the democratic party actually had intentions of addressing high home prices, they'd be doing it on the state level where the democrats have supermajorites in the state legislatures and hold the executive branch. Places like California, Illinois, the northeast, New York, etc. To my knowledge they mostly aren't doing anything to fix the issue. California passed some laws recently but they had a lot of trouble, and the California state legislature is 70% democrat.",

And because of that, they take on this tone of there's nothing we can do. And it infects all of their coverage.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAgain, as the very wise Jay Rosen put it, the fundamental asymmetry between the two parties fries the circuits of the mainstream press.

And so many times he sounds like the biggest moron you've ever heard speak.  Remember the little impromptu musings he had about Gettysburg? If Biden had said that people would have assumed he was either completely demented or else a complete idiot.

Ok sure, but I think he might be stronger on the economy.\n\nHowever, in this case I can somewhat understand how people can think this way.

But if and when he makes some mistakes in facts or names he gets ridiculed and people worry about his mental state, whereas if Trump makes similar mistakes it gets glossed over.  Again: the double standard.\n\nRepublicans and Democrats care about whether or not Joe Biden is fit to lead, and worry when he doesn not appear to be so.  Not just now.  How will he be in 3-4 years?\n\nOnly Democrats and a few honest (and usually only *former* politicians or officials) conservatives care whether or not Trump is fit to lead.

He is a living totem for conservative grievance.\n\nIt doesn't matter that he's a serial adulterer and has a long history of wanton sexual degeneracy, he is against trans folks and abortion and would probably let us shove the gays back in the closet if we wanted to.\n\nIt doesn't matter that he is a liar and a thief and a conman, he is against immigrants.\n\nIt doesn't matter, as he famously bragged, if he shoots someone dead in the middle of the street, he is against the woke crt snowflake social justice cancel culture mob.\n\nThey couldn't care less what Trump IS, they care who and what he gives them political validation to hate.\n\nSo even though he has angry incoherent ranting scumbag grandpa energy, they could not possibly care less.\n\nMeanwhile the Dems, generally, are not like that. While of course there is room in democratic politics for grievance candidates, they don't tend to do as well or get as far. Those on the left (relative to US politics that is, I know the Dems in most European countries would not be considered the left at all), care far more about causes and policies than grievance, and therefore, candidates have a higher standard of at least showing some level of personal integrity and competence to do the job.\n\nNow I know some of you are rolling your eyes, cause there have of course been some major democratic corrupt buffoons, but I am speaking in relative terms here, as in relative to the democratic party. There is no Democratic Trump. The is no democratic Marjorie Taylor Green. There is no Democratic Lauren Boebert. Arguably there is no Democratic Matt Gaetz. The racial whackadoo fringe elements of the Dem party are like....AOC, who, whether you agree with her politics or not, is still quite manifestly FAR more informed and competent and Gaetz or Boebert or Taylor Green.\n\nSo to bring that back to answer your question: Because what Donald Trump is doesn't matter, his personal competencies are irrelevant, he serves as a conduit for grievance and that's all he needs to do. I'm sure 80% of the GOP would be quite content if he just fucked off to Mar a Lago for the rest of his life and played golf and just signed whatever the freedom caucus put in front of him.\n\nMeanwhile Biden is expected to actually do things, have ideas, lead, be effective, pursue politics and policies and agendas and negotiate and lead and govern. So his personal capacity matters a lot more to his constituents than Trumps does to his.\n\nSo yes, even though Trump is prone to completely incoherent angry rants, that's all they need to be, angry ranting grandpa. Who gives a shit if he cant remember what he was talking about half the time, the theme of the angry rant is obviously anti-woke and anti-immigrant, and that's all they need.",

Trump leading in poles isn\u2019t a reflection of Trumps popularity but how negative Biden is being viewed. The Democrats best chance at winning is running a better candidate, it would literally take away any reason for independents to look at Trump and could sway moderate conservatives that really don\u2019t like Trump but hate Biden. This could change but right now this election is shaping up to be a referendum on Biden and not Trump. With a well selected candidate this could be switched and Trump easily loses.

If your base and down ballot don\u2019t support him he\u2019s very likely to lose.

Trump would ruin his political career and excommunicate him from the Republican Party because he would be seen as disloyal. Remember, Trump values loyalty and submission to him above all else. That's why Vance was chosen.\n\n\nThe concerning part of this is that Trump holds so much power in the party that he has the ability to decide a fellow party member's fate based on if they like him or not. So naturally, the ones that want to maintain relevance in the party will believe whatever crackpot ideas Trump promotes and in my opinion, Vance is just believing whatever will advance his career.\n\nThe concerning part to me is just how much MAGA has a grip on the discourse of the Republican Party and their promotion of 2020 election denialism is only a symptom of their total control of the party.\n\nAs someone that has voted for Republicans in the past, it is painfully obvious that MAGA is a cancer in American politics and the only way to cure this cancer is to vote against it so it loses relevance.",

Before the pandemic, the economy was thriving, wages were growing, and manufacturing jobs were returning at the fastest rate in over 30 years. He prioritized everyday Americans, and we saw real results.\n\nLowering Drug Prices & Healthcare: Trump tackled prescription drug prices, resulting in a 1.1% decrease overall, something we hadn\u2019t seen in decades. He also worked on price transparency in healthcare, helping Americans avoid surprise medical bills and enabling them to shop for better prices.\n\nCriminal Justice Reform: With the First Step Act, Trump delivered much-needed criminal justice reform, particularly benefiting Black Americans by reducing overly harsh sentences for non-violent crimes. This law focused on rehabilitating inmates and reducing recidivism, setting a real precedent for bipartisan cooperation.\n\nSupport for Veterans: Trump strengthened support for veterans, holding the VA accountable and improving mental health services for those transitioning to civilian life. His policies helped make sure our veterans receive the care and respect they deserve.\n\nOpportunity Zones: Through his Opportunity Zones initiative, Trump drove investments into low-income communities across the country, spurring economic growth and creating jobs where they were needed most.\n\nLGBTQ+ Rights: Despite misconceptions, Trump appointed 5 openly gay ambassadors and led a global effort to decriminalize homosexuality, demonstrating that he values freedom and individual rights for all.\n\nEnvironmental Achievements: While often overlooked, Trump signed the largest wilderness protection and conservation bill in a decade, protecting 375,000 acres of land. He also tackled ocean pollution through the Save Our Seas Act.\n\nTrump is also the president who signed legislation to combat animal cruelty, making it a federal felony.\n\nAt a time when we\u2019re facing global uncertainty, national security remains a priority, and Trump\u2019s leadership on military reform, including the creation of Space Force, shows a forward-thinking approach to protecting America. Additionally, his efforts to eliminate ISIS\u2019s control and bring home countless hostages illustrate his commitment to keeping America safe.",

Joe Biden was declared the winner and is President, but not from a legitimate election.\n\nLaws were violated through rule changes and procedures allowed a result changing amount of fraud to occurr. \n\nTrump and the not so faithful Republican Party got caught off guard by these changes and failed to raise objections to rule changes prior to the voting. Therefore, when he objected to there legitimacy after the fact courts simply dismissed the cases due to standing and legitimacy issues.\n\nThis is a far cry from saying there is no evidence of fraud. There is obvious evidence of fraud that has never been vetted by anyone other than the people who would have perpetrated it. To deny this is simply being dishonest with yourself or not paying attention. \n\nNote that 22 State Attorney Generals raised concerns about the election but were denied an airing of the facts due to standing and laches. \n\nAlso the US Senate was raising a challenge to certification of the election and as that process was beginning and Senators were going to have to record their opinions on the matter, Ashley Babbit was shot in the Capitol Building for no justifiable reason. An event there has been no public scrutiny of. Six hours later the reconvened Senate set aside the public airing of the objection and certified the results without further debate.\n\nHowever, if all the irregularities and above issues are made up in my mind, I would still challenge you to this. \n\nProduce 71 Million lawfully cast ballots (electronic or paper) with corresponding but not linked lawfully registered voters for Joe Biden. The law requires these be maintained. The public has a right to them. Its the mark of a fair and open election. \n\nInterestly enough this cannot be done in Pennsilvania, Georgia, Arizonia, Michigan, or Wisconsin. If the Mainstream Media were not a propaganda opperation for one side, you would know this. \n\nThe final bit of proof there was a problem with 2020's election is the fact that Democrats attempting to do it again. While courts have upheld rule changes preventing unlawful voting, Democrats have repeatedly taken steps to alter rules to allow unlawful votes to avoid scrutiny. They oppose voters have to prove citizenship to register. They oppose having to present identification to vote. They oppose ballots having to be submitted by the deadlines. The only reason to oppose these things in this modern age where every has to have identification to do almost anything is a desire to cheat. \n\nYeah, Joe Biden won the unlawfully conducted election of 2020. He is the President, just not lawfully elected President.",

Trump, and by extension Vance, need to start priming people to believe the Big Lie 2.0, which we all know is coming. In order to get the message out that the only way Democrats can win is by cheating, they want people to believe it happened before in 2020.

That's a very delicate task.  If you go to a pure popular vote, you can almost guarantee, like water flowing downhill, that the urban interest will consume the entire focus of the federal government.  If the goal is good government, as opposed to merely staging horse races, a continent wide popular vote is a bad way to proceed in keeping a continent wide cohesive union.\n\nThe good news for the popular vote crowd that believes the minority has too much power is that electoral college influence DOES move your way as populations migrate to cities every generation in increasing numbers.  It's just that it changes the electoral map SLOWLY, which IMO is a feature not a bug.  Sudden disruptions / changes in the structure of government are historically cataclysmic.  \n\nOn swing states: not only do these change over time, but if you look at the demographics of what makes a swing state...a swing state.....they demographically mirror the BROAD demands the structure of the system is designed to place on a presidential candidate.  Look at Pennsylvania.  That state has what can fairly be described as every type of \"interest\"---from race, class, profession, religion, lifestyle, urban, rural---that we want our POTUS to have appealed to.  You have to account for the rural amish and the urban Philly voter.  If you currently live in a blue city in a red state, or a California exurb, your task is to get to know your state politics, your neighbors, and convince those closest to you to change their mind.  That is the whole point (and may actually get us back to being more united).  Change the electoral vote closest to you, don't plead for a lifeline that only cements divisions based on raw numbers.

If somehow the same ever happened in California, again, it would activate millions of Republicans who otherwise are unreliable.\n\nThis effect would occur Nationwide if we got rid of the electoral college. It would not necessarily be a win for Democrats. However, I do think it would have a moderating effect on the GOP, which currently caters to some crazy niche interest that don't otherwise appeal to the broader electorate.

She dominated the debate.\n\n* Harris' lack of specifics about economic plans (aside from things like business start-up tax credit which will have appeal to a limited number of voters) means that if they are still mostly concerned with the economy, she may not have won them over.  A debate is not a good format to get a lot of details across, but she probably could have outlined more the kinds of directions she would go to help improve things.  She will need to do more of that on the campaign trail.\n\n* Trump just showed us more of the same of why so many intensely dislike him, and I suspect did little to move anyone more into his favor.  However, he did hit Harris pretty hard on Afghanistan for example and I don't think she had a strong rebuttal about that specific issue.\n\n* I think it's pretty rare that one event like a debate will really make people decide one way or another.  A debate is just another factor that people will add to their consideration and so could move them over time, but is unlikely to move them by the next day.\n\n* One additional point about something I hear from voters asked that drives me crazy: the \"Are you better off now than 4 years ago?\" test.  That is a ridiculous standard because it completely leaves out any context, and yet so many people seem to think it's an ok standard to use.  How low info can you be that this is your standard?

Furthermore, her touting on the success of the economy falls short when you have insurance companies uping their prices, grocery bills exceeding American budgets, housing prices just out of control, etc. \n\nListen, when I found out Harris was running, I got excited. I admit that the whole personality and \"Blue Wave\" vibes really got me stoked for the party! However, as the time goes on, I'm beginning to be more critical about her policies for the next 4 years.

Harris is said to have called it an existential threat and referred to the greatest legislation addressing climate change that the administration passed. \n\nI havent seen anyone else talk about this yet and wanted to delve deeper into her full response:\n\n>VICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: Well, the former president had said that climate change is a hoax. And what we know is that it is very real. You ask anyone who lives in a state who has experienced these extreme weather occurrences who now is either being denied home insurance or is being jacked up. You ask anybody who has been the victim of what that means in terms of losing their home, having nowhere to go. We know that we can actually deal with this issue. The young people of America care deeply about this issue.\n\nGiven she had limited time to respond, I think it's clear she was stalling for some ideas here. Reiterating the prompt that climate change is important to young voters and basically just talking about Trump and his views for almost half her response.\n\n>And I am proud that as vice president over the last four years, we have invested a trillion dollars in a clean energy economy while we have also increased domestic gas production to historic levels. We have created over 800,000 new manufacturing jobs while I have been vice president. We have invested in clean energy to the point that we are opening up factories around the world. Donald Trump said he was going to create manufacturing jobs. He lost manufacturing jobs. And I'm also proud to have the endorsement of the United Auto Workers and Shawn Fain, who also know that part of building a clean energy economy includes investing in American-made products, American automobiles. It includes growing what we can do around American manufacturing and opening up auto plants, not closing them like what happened under Donald Trump.\n\nSo essentially 1) we increased manufacturing jobs by increasing American automobile production, 2) we increased domestic gas production.\n\nThis sounds like the answer to a different question about how she's brought more jobs home from abroad rather than the answer to a question about climate change. And, gas and automobiles contribute to climate change. Honestly felt like this was one of kamala's worst answers from the debate.",

This gives them time to edit out her blunders, so it\u2019s really not giving us a real look at her ability to articulate herself. I think she owes it to voters to speak unscripted and alone; because the thing is, if she\u2019s the president, she won\u2019t have Walz there as a security blanket when she\u2019s meeting with Putin and Kim Jong Un. And I don\u2019t think any one of us really values an interview that was \u201cpre-recorded\u201d especially by a media affiliate that is of the same party as the candidate. Right? For example, if Trump were to sit down for an interview, but only with Fox News, only with Vance by his side, and only if it\u2019s pre-recorded and edited\u2026 would the democrats accept this as being courageous and fair of Trump? No, of course not. But Kamala is doing this exact same thing, and it shocks me that people who claim to be fair and intellectually honest, are accepting this arrangement. Look, Americans deserve to hear Kamala speak without a speech writer or someone beside her to deflect to. Surely we can all \u2014 whether Republican or Democrat\u2014 agree on this? It\u2019s not too much to ask of our presidential candidate to do interviews alone, to speak to the media (a lot), and to debate the opponent without being given the questions beforehand and without extra \u201chelp\u201d\u2026 I\u2019m sure we can all agree that we would like to know that any presidential candidate is smart, articulate, and always willing and able to talk unscripted about policies. JD Vance is a great example of this\u2014 brilliant, articulate, always willing to talk without a buddy or script there to help him. Do you think Kamala will do well when she sits down \u2014 alone \u2014 with Kim Jong Un and Putin one day? I think we all know the answer to this.",

An already heated election with heavy tensions on both sides will become much worse.\n\nTrump supporters will likely feel more validated taking extreme actions, violence or otherwise. Some non-violent results might include (more) extreme policies, judicial rulings, movements, which may be particularly targeted.\n\nIn short, likely the direct opposite of the shooter's intent. Sought to eliminate Trump from the race (among other things), likely handed it to him.

Left seems more focused on what the negative results will be for their side. Right seems more focused on the understandable concern that this happened in the first place and that it shouldn't ever happen and that it seems crazy to them that those on the other side seem so concerned about themselves instead. There's definitely some fighting though, have seen some right side commenters emboldened to make wild claims about the left and saying things like they deserve anything that happens to them as a result. Unclear if that's just base tribalization or actual escalated tension. I don't tend to read political shit slinging back and forth comment threads so it's hard for me to say.

With the advancement of women in the workforce I think some of the older laws with regards to alimony definitely need to be updated. I believe in cases with divorce caused by abuse, the abuser should be punished harshly by the courts. In cases of divorces caused by infidelity, the cheater should be punished harshly by the court.

Women are not going to stay home and make 10 babies per family, and they are not going to give up their options to choose the type of work they want.\n* As to Divorce,  it is far better  that some people who choose to, get a divorce, Rather than people staying together who no longer want to be together, until one harms or kill the other.\n* Trying to tell people who they can sleep with, regardless of what label they choose to call themselves, is **never** going to keep people from doing what they want to do with their sexual lives. \n* Trying to force Right Wing White Nationalist version of Religion, cannot and **will not** be forced upon All of Society. \n\nThe very people (Right Wingers/Conservatives)  who are always talking about *\"they want the government to get out of their lives\"* , They (Right Winger/Conservatives) are the very people who are pushing these bills and trying to promote policy, to dictate over the lives of women, and peoples relationships by and through the usage of the government.

Judge Cannon\u2019s dismissal was done on the basis that the appointment of Jack Smith itself is unconstitutional, as a violation of the Appointments clause of the Constitution, which makes appointing inferior government officers a power that only Congress holds, unless Congress vests that power in someone else. \n\nThis decision does indeed come off as hypocritical (multiple special counsels have been appointed in the past without Congress\u2019s approval), and I don\u2019t think that Judge Cannon\u2019s decision would be the judicial consensus in this situation. But I also don\u2019t think that many judges are going to be willing to overturn this decision; even though Judge Cannon dismissing the case was a long-shot decision, it does have a constitutional basis, regardless of how hypocritical the application of that clause is in this context. \n\nIn a way, this decision\u2019s impact will be similar to cases that are dismissed or diminished on the basis of the 4th Amendment exclusionary rule, (also known informally as the \u201cfruits of the poisonous tree doctrine\u201d). In other words, just like any evidence built off of an improper search and seizure has to be thrown out, this entire case has to be thrown out because the appointment of Jack Smith was ruled to be unconstitutional in and of itself by the Appointments clause of the Constitution.\n\nBased on the facts of the case, I always felt that this was the strongest of the cases against Trump, and I also felt that it was also the least likely to be dismissed due to the Supreme Court \u201cofficial acts\u201d ruling, as a lot of Trump\u2019s charges in this case stem from things he did after he was President. But now that this case has been dropped, the strongest of all of them, I\u2019m now confident that we\u2019re just weeks away from the January 6th case being dropped, the Georgia election interference case being dropped, and the Hush Money conviction being overturned. \n\nBasically, Trump will no longer be a convicted felon, nor will he be at risk of being convicted for anything else he has done up until now.",

This comment potentially can lose him support from a crucial voting demographic that he needs to win. This is front page univision and telemundo material until the election.\n\n2) The fact that a rando Trump supporter said it is much worse for Trump than if Trump said it. Trump is the leader of a cult. His cult will make any excuse under the sun for Trump. A rando doesn\u2019t get that support. Some republicans are firmly against it, some are doubling down, some are claiming he was a plant. The way you erode Trump\u2019s support is by painting his supports are racist losers. The one thing Trump supporters don\u2019t want to be called is racist not because they necessarily care about racism but rather because it will hurt their social standing. The tricky part with Democrats is they cant actually attack Trump supporter because it looks bad to attack voters (see point 1). However, a rando behind a Trump podium at a Trump rally getting laughs at clearly racist jokes basically removes all cover. It basically screams \u201cTrump supporters are racists, do you want to join them?\u201d Without a democrat having to say it",

He isn't able to listen, comprehend and answer or reliably keep his train of thought or express himself clearly. This is not about his stutter and he might have good days and bad days and maybe this was a bad day but take a fucking step back and remember what job we are talking about here, that it runs for 4 years and that he has obviously gone down hill, a lot, since the last election debates. And does anyone want to roll around to the next debate before this election and hope Biden has a better day, knowing it would be far too late to change nominee then if he delivers another train wreck?\n\nThe fact that he was facing up against Trump who is perhaps only marginally more coherent sounding than him, far more morally reprehensible, a blatant liar, and surrounded by bad people who genuinely hate democracy doesn't make it any more okay to persist with Biden as the nominee, in fact it is a overwhelming reason to absolutely get a different democratic nominee now.

Biden's approval rating is currently at 37.6%. From where I'm sitting, with the information I have at hand, Trump's chances of a win in November are still looking quite good.

Has been since the beginning. In fact, when it comes to my vote and the votes of a significant number of others, the GOP can make no better decision than pushing Trump out the door.

I don't think so. The Republicans had their chance to choose Trump Light and go with Desantis and he bombed. Now any prospective candidate either has to be the polar opposites of Trump and that will result in the loss of Trump voters or try and be Trump light and face the same defeat as Desantis. Also even if Trump drops out there is no guarantee that people will not write him in anyways splitting the Republican vote between Trump and Trump\u2019s replacement. \n\nYou also have to consider Trump, even if he doesn't win will still get people to the polls which could be beneficial for down ballot Republicans. The opposite is also true. Not running Trump could result in a lower turnout for Republicans which will have consequences down ballot and could result in Democrats taking house, senate and the Presidency. A democratic Trifecta could be harmful for Republicans long-term objectives. \n\nFor Trump this election is about more than becoming President it is about granting himself a pardon for his Federal cases. So he is campaigning like his life depends on it because at his age and with his ego being found guilty of federal crimes is a death sentence.\n\n\nThe best thing republicans could do is split the baby. Both have Trump on the ballot to get his supporters to the polls and have another Candidate on the Ballot as either Potus with Trump as Vice President or Vice versa. The objective is to have a less polarizing Candidate paired with Trump who ready to take charge when Trump pardons himself or if they POTUS and Trump is Vice they get to appear as a great unified ending the Trump Trial debacle. \n\nThey could frame it as the Evil Democrats already convicted Trump once and the only way to stop that from happening again is for Trump to be pardoned on Federal charges.

That means 3% undecided for president and 11% undecided for senate. In 2020 Biden got 49.4% of the vote and Trump got 49.0% of the vote.\n\nA lot of people just look at headlines and say \"Trump leads by 5 and Gallego (D) leads by 7 how is this possible\" but I think the actual data tells a different story.\n\nAccording to the poll Trump is doing 2 points better than his 2020 performance. That could be a slight improvement or it could be statistical noise. Harris is underperforming Biden's margin by about 3 points but there are also 3% undecided. In a state that's historically red but home to  many disaffected former Republicans it's not THAT surprising to me that some of those Biden 2020 voters are still saying they are \"undecided.\" Overall I expect most of them to break for Harris and I expect her to either win AZ by up to one point or lose by 3 points or less. For Senate it seems like there are still a disproportionate number of Trump 2020 voters still saying \"undecided\" and I expect them to break for Lake. Gallego may win but he won't win by 7 and maybe he wins by low single digits. With a 7 point lead and 11 percent saying \"undecided\" we also can't permanently write off Lake's chances.\n\n[senate polls](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/senate/2024/arizona/)\n\n[prez polls](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-general/2024/arizona/)\n\nEdit TLDR: Trump isn't going to win AZ by five and Gallego isn't going to win by 7. It's likely to be much closer for both of them and I don't think a 3-5 point split would be nearly as shocking to people as the current polling indicates.",

The reason why it seemed to happen so fast was because most of the real work had already happened. I don't know why people assume that what they say in public is all they've been saying. They have telephones and emails -- they talk to each other all the time!

I think it also doesn't capture the fact taht the Trump/Vance campaign failed to counter her rise effectively where they could've been busy tying CA's failed policies to Harris and instead resorting to racist insults and namecalling.\n\nSo it's 2 things:\n\n1. There's a resurgence of energy, enthusiasm not captured in the approvals and polling. The resurgence of energy just having Harris take over is much like a convention bump itself.\n\n2.

Plus they knew Trump wouldn\u2019t expect it. He is not a real politician and was not ready with a backup strategy. He went all in on Joe and effectively used up his ammo. He\u2019s firing blanks now.\n\nDem voters agreed in the change plan, because the only thing giving Trump those inflated poll numbers was that out of the two old men, Trump seemed to be declining at a slightly slower pace.

The news media has basically flipped from \"Biden Old\" to \"Harris Positive Energy\" in terms of the D's messaging. There was a cadence of managed endorsements over the last \\~4 weeks. They were metered out to get a new news cycle every day for a while.\n\nIt also helps that Trump keeps sticking his foot in his mouth, James Vance (sorry, we're not doing that name change nonsense here) is a turd of a candidate, and the GOP - in general - has had terrible policies to run on. Trump has coopted the RNC and they've tried to bury Project 2025, but it keeps hitting the news cycles. Most people that look at that are likely responding negatively to it. Trump's \"negative energy\" vibe appears to be tanking with voters. Personally he's emotionally exhausting. I'm sure there are more out that that think the same. I mean, the dude almost got assassinated and no one cares.\n\nIt also helps that there are people like VP candidate Walz, MI Gov. Whitmer, PA, IL, etc. governors hitting the news cycles in positive ways. (Has CA Gov. Newsom hit the news yet?) There's way too much going on for this to be all orchestrated. Pretty sure there have been strategy calls even before Biden dropping out to do message management (at least, that's what I'd do). So the coordination is there, but it's not directly managed.\n\nThe last \\~4 weeks have been crazy good for the DNC. The amateur conspiracy theorist in me wants to think this was all a master plan. It will take a long time to see if that's true. More likely that the Harris campaign just has really good people working together that have made really good decisions to turn the momentum. The satellite people - the aforementioned governors - have also played well with the Harris campaign.\n\n(edit: grammar)",

On that same note I think the carping from the professional chattering class that she hasn't done a presser or issues policy statements is simply a bunch of BS; most voters are simply not engaged, ever, so they vote nebulously for the person who they think will best represent them (the exception here are single issue voters). \n\nAll in all I'm still surprised that this all is a surprise to the Nate Silver/538's of the world that expect politics to follow in lockstep to their preconceived notions.

Kamala isn't ideal, but she's young, has a goofy aunt energy that makes for easy memes and genuinely feels like she's taking us away from Biden's old way of doing things.\n\n2.  She picked Tim Walz.  The dude's a charmer.  He's a pragmatic populist, isn't ridiculously rich and feels like a normal human being. The fact she picked the guy the Internet was raving about, and not the guy the establishment Dems were pushing is big, too.

Donald Trump can't handle it. His campaign fell apart when she joined, as they were only prepared to fight Biden. The media had been working so hard to sell this narrative that Trump was \"a changed man\" following the assassination attempt, but then Trump immediately goes full racist. He just seems old, miserable and increasingly confused these days.  \n\nReally quite a historic election all around.",

This is a very powerful meaning for women in general but also anyone else who feels disenfranchised by race or gender. \n\nThere's also the fact that Kamala is a very different candidate than Biden. I hate to say it, but Biden is not a very offensive style of politician. He may have been when he was younger, but he's reached an age where everything starts to fade fairly quickly for the average person. He's still fairly sharp for someone his age, but he's fading fast and people were realizing it. It's not his fault and he should never be blamed for the effects of old age. \n\nTrump on the other hand I know for a fact is fading fast as well, but he's trying to hide it with upper drugs, like pick me up drugs. He rambles and makes no fucking sense at all. It's actually sad that he's pushing himself so much, but it's his life and if he gives up on the presidency he's likely going to prison or house arrest. \n\nAnyways, Kamala Harris is a vastly different candidate that is more offensive, vibrant and young compared to the both of them. She actually understands current pop culture far more than the other two combined. The DNC can build an offensive strategy around her and Walz brings in that gentle midwestern charm.

So what does that mean?\n\nTo me, this actually validates much of what the pro-Biden folks were saying: that Trump was just riding a good bubble, that as soon as the news cycle turned over from the debate and Biden being old then voters would be reminded how bad Trump is, that the polls in July tend to change pretty notably, and that the underlying fundamentals of the race were remarkably good for the Dems. Maybe the anti-Bidenites were also right that the news cycle NEVER would have turned over with Biden as the nominee, but it's pretty much beyond belief that one person can make this kind of change with this kind of speed just using their own power, especially when we consider that Harris was even MORE unpopular than Biden was.\n\nUltimately, these things are pretty hard to nail down single specific causes, especially in the moment. There is absolutely signal here, but there's also SO MUCH noise. We can't really answer this question with any degree of certainty until we're in the future and able to look back in hindsight.

That he would win by default since Trump was so polarizing. Most of us liberals had to sit silently while AOC and others we thought had the future in mind were saying \"its too late to switch, Biden is our guy\". Felt like we were sleepwalking to an authoritarian future and nobody cared. Trump's side was gleeful and our side was nonchalant.\n\nSuddenly Biden dropped out, and immediately stood behind Kamala. I think at first we were so elated that we had a new candidate, that it was a feeling of, \"are we really doing this, ok lets do this!\" collective excitement. The other added bonus for Kamala is that she is like the backup quarterback who comes in at the end of the game to win. Dem's have been beaten down by election after election we won by more votes, but lost to Elecetoral College. That kind of shit makes you more knowledgeable about the system. When you get cheated by a system for so long, you start to look up why.\n\nWe collectively know that we dont have time for an open convention, that Biden's ONLY choice was Kamala so she could keep the fundraising money.

Shit's insane.\n\nAnd as we got behind her and started thinking about it, she is tough, she's a woman but its not her whole persona, (like it was with Hillary), she is a great public speaker, she made a great choice with Walz, and to simplify it, she is young and NOT Trump.

His kids are crying, his wife is screaming, and there\u2019s no room to even breathe let alone turn around.\n\n> So when the poor man goes back to the rabbi, and the rabbi asks with a twinkle in his eye how the week went, the man breaks down in tears.\n\n> \u201cRabbi, it was a nightmare!\u201d the man sobs. \u201cMy kids are miserable, my wife is miserable, I am miserable.\u201d\n\n> \u201cAlright,\u201d the rabbi says \u201cgo home, take out the goat and come back after Shabbos,\u201d\n\n> So, when Shabbat ends and three stars twinkle in the sky, the man is practically dancing down the road to the rabbi.\n\n> \u201cNu?\u201d the rabbi asks. \u201cHow was it?\u201d\n\n> \u201cRabbi!\u201d the man said \u201cIt\u2019s a miracle!

The race definitely favors Trump, but it's a close race with a lot of potential volatility (lots of undecideds, third-party candidates polling high, etc.). It's nowhere close to a wrap, and anybody telling you that is dumb or selling you something.\n\nIn regards to the 538 results, their model doesn't just consider poll results, it also considers non-polling factors that influence elections. (I don't know exactly what these are, but I'd assume they're things like incumbency, the economy, approval ratings.) Especially with polling having been kind of off in several recent elections, they've found that adding some weight to these factors gets them closer to accurate predictions of past elections than polling alone did. So that may favor Biden more than the polls do. \n\nThey've also mentioned that their model adds more weight to the polls as we get closer to the election, so if the polls still look the same in October, Biden's odds will likely get lower in their forecast.\n\nIt's worth noting that ABC cut staff from 538 last year; Nate Silver is no longer with the site. (He has a new model at his new site.) So this isn't necessarily the same model 538 has worked with in the past, and we don't know what its track record will look like.

Betting markets also said The Chiefs would lose to the Bills, The Ravens and The 49ers. Betting markets are not set up to predict winners, they are set up to make money.\n3. How many pundits got 2016 right? How many thought we'd go to bed knowing who the winner was in 2020? Pundits are there to make ratings not make good predictions. They are for entertainment.\n4.

The model is giving Biden advantages for incumbancy (home team) and certain other fundamentals based on historical data. So it thinks if you play out the second half 100 times with all the uncertainty that 4 months brings, he's basically got a 50/50 shot to come back.\n\nIt's really important to realize this model is not a \"if the election was held today\", it's a \"what are the range of possible paths that could occur over the next 4 months.\"\n\nIf Trump's polling lead holds, his 538 forecast will keep trending up as the election gets closer.",

The polling always showed that Democrats could do well and it was a close election. It was the media that said Democrats had no chance. And democrats ate it up then too. \n\nThe polling now shows the same thing despite the amount of stories people are writing. Biden is within the margin of error in all the polling. Margins of error exist for a reason. The error could very well be in the model itself because people are anticipating more Trump support than actually will materialize.\n\nI like Kamala Harris but she is untested in National campaign and the media will go apeshit trying to vet her in two months because they couldn\u2019t do it during a full campaign and Republicans will make them do it. Anyone who thinks the New York Times will be kind to her is kidding themselves.\n\nIt\u2019s crazy to think her negatives won\u2019t go up when she starts getting attacked and she is already essentially tied with Joe Biden against Trump now. Imagine when they start working on her past or asking when she knew Biden was in decline and why she hid it. \n\nPeople need to stop and think things through. Just because it would make people feel better to have a shiny new candidate, does not mean that they will do well. And dumping an incumbent president for the first time in American history when incumbents almost always win, is colossally risky.",
