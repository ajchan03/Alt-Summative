In my opinion he single handily turned the campaign around with his phenomenal VP debate performance. He gave calm, concise and rational answers to explain even some of the most difficult issues for voters to understand about Trump and his policies. He went into the lions den without fear to always answer and battle with the MSM. What a man!",
