The final package was agreed to by all parties and signed off on by McConnell as well as Democratic leaders before Trump publicly came out against it and urged his allies in the House and Senate GOP to kill it. The reason, according to widespread reporting including the above, was that he wanted to run his campaign on there being chaos at the border and him being the solution to fix it, and he worried that the proposed bill would resolve the problem and deprive him of something to run on. \n\nSince then, Trump has made immigration and the idea of a border crises the central point of his campaign. He's gone to every border state to rant about it and lambast Democrats for not fixing it. He's brought it up in every appearance, at every interview, at the presidential debate. He's tied the border to false stories about migrants coming over to eat people's pets. He brings it up at every rally. Yet it was he himself who worked to ensure that it wasn't fixed, and now his own party's Senate leader acknowledges it. \n\nWhat sort of impact do you think this will have on the election?

Trump didn't maintain his edge over Harris since the movable vote didn't split between him and her.\n\nWhy do you think that most of the third party and undecided vote moved to Harris rather than splitting their votes? Is it just because Harris is new despite the fact that most voters disapproved of Harris as VP before she became the nominee? Can Harris get away with not answering reporters' questions or sitting for an interview? Did Trump stumble by not focusing his attack on her left-wing record?

Bush added to it after Bill Clinton left him a surplus, and Donald Trump added almost as much to it in his first term as Barack Obama did in two terms, can Republicans still say they are the party committed to lowering the debt with any credibility?",

He also praised the New York Police Department's infamous clear-out of encampments at Columbia University as a model for the nation. \n\nAnother interesting part was Trump changing his tune on Israel's offensive. In public he has been very cautious in his comments as his campaign believes the war is hurting President Biden's support among key constituencies like young people and people of color, so he has only made vague references to how Israel is \u201closing the PR war\u201d and how we have to get back to peace. But in private Trump is telling donors and supporters that he will support Israel's right to defend itself and continue its \"war on terror\", as well as boasting about his track record of pro-Israel policy including moving the US embassy there to Jerusalem in 2018 and making the US the first country to recognize the Israeli annexation of the Golan Heights in 2019. \n\nAnd what are your thoughts on how this could impact the election? Does it add more fuel to the argument that a vote for Trump is a vote for unbridled fascism to be unleashed in the US? As mentioned, the war has also hurt Joe Biden's support among young people and people of color. Will getting a clearer look at and understanding the alternative impact this dynamic?",

However, Trump may have opened the door to a national discussion about the various other ways Republicans could severely limit abortion access nationwide without congress or new legislative action. One of these ways is through the FDA. \n\nPreviously, FDA authorization of Mifepristone aka the abortion pill couldn't be rolled back due to the protections of Roe v. Wade. However, with Roe gone and thus abortion no longer protected nationally thanks to Trump's own Supreme Court appointees, Trump is now free to install any zealot, radical or fundamentalist he chooses as head of the Department of Health and Human Services **(HHS)**, the Food and Drug Administration **(FDA)** and others to pursue federal action like this, as a lot of the remaining means to protect or curtail access go through these types of agencies. This can function as an alternative to having to muscle through a new nationwide abortion ban through Congress, and allows you to campaign on \"leaving it to the states\" while knowing you'll have various levers to pull to ban or restrict it nationally anyways once in office that the average citizen might not be aware of.\n\nWith Trump seemingly letting the cat out of the bag, how does it impact the elections, both presidential and downballot?

She also attacked Trump's sales tax \\[dubbed tariffs\\] and Tax cuts to the super rich. She called her own plan an economic opportunity and the support it has garnered.

He also promised to stop Social Security Benefits tax. Trump said he will create the greatest economy in the world. He stated that under the Biden economy people are dying because they cannot afford bacon and eggs.\n\nTrump appeared frustrated with Harris hard hitting responses and he began calling Harris names such as a Marxist, called her father a Marxist too \\[he was a professor of economics\\] He added she is letting criminals in.  To which Harris noted she is the only one on the stage who has prosecuted transnational drug dealers, she noted that Trump called his friends in Congress to kill the bipartisan immigration bill for his talking point. Trump's come back was that the immigrants were killing and eating the pets. The panel rejected that as false on the stage having talked to the mayor of the locality at issue. \n\nTrump was questioned about his mass deportation plan, and he said yes, he would do it sending federal law enforcements, local police and national guard door to door to deport 11 million plus people. He also defended the people who rioted on January 6, 2021, claiming they were singled out. \n\nHe added he had nothing to do with the riot \\[he wanted peaceful protest\\]. In the end he blamed Nancy Pelosi. Harris in her response held Trump responsible for the insurrection and interjected Charlottesville during the conversation. When asked if he now acknowledges he lost the 2020 election, Trump denied on the stage he ever lost the election though he said, he lost by a whisker earlier during the week.  \n\nAs to wars Trump said it would never happen if he were in charge and that he could stop the Ukraine war before he even enters office.  Harris said Trump would just surrender Ukraine and that she believed in Ukraine's integrity and that she supported NATO. As to Afghanistan, Harris asserted Trump made the weakest deal to withdraw.  \n\nOn Climate change Harris noted that Trump has called it a hoax. Harris is said to have called it an existential threat and referred to the greatest legislation addressing climate change that the administration passed.  \n\nOn question of race and color Harris seemed to have hit a home run and recited Trump's history of race bating.

Her approvals on 538 were similar to Joe Biden's, [hovering around the high 30s/low 40s. ](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/approval/kamala-harris/)\n\nAccording to this piece, \"[Her\u00a0numbers are lower than her four immediate predecessors at this point in their terms, though Dan Quayle\u2019s unfavorables were worse. So were Dick Cheney\u2019s in his second term.\"](https://www.yahoo.com/news/fact-check-kamala-harris-most-120000844.html) So she was worse than VP Pence and VP Biden polling wise.\n\nFast forward to July 2024, Biden steps down. Kamala swoops in and quickly gets endorsements from AOC to Obama. Cash starts piling in, Kamala's polls go up (especially in the swing state), Trump's polls go down. Even long time right leaning pollster Frank Luntz called it the [\"biggest turnaround I've ever seen.\" ](https://www.thetimes.com/uk/politics/article/frank-luntz-unless-something-dramatic-happens-trump-is-the-next-president-8sd7d5fww)\n\nMy question is how? Kamala is the same person she's been since she was a VP and running mate with Biden. She hasn't changed her mind on any issues that we know of except for the recent speech[ she made to go after price gouging and down payment assistance for first time home buyers. ](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/kamala-harris-dnc-economic-plan-price-gouging-ban-inflation/)\n\nIs it the mere fact that there is a clear contrast between Kamala vs Trump now? (old white guy vs younger black woman) Is it artificial momentum i.e media created? Or is it something else?",

However, Universal Healthcare is very much a negative for campaign donors. \n\nWhen will we stop chasing donor dollars and start doing what is right for the majority of American's who desire it?

I brought up the fact that there are other social issues that could be affected, but they called me tone deaf for comparing that to an active genocide. They have no hope for the Democrat party, want the two party system to burn to the ground, and for all of us to collectively suffer. \n\nI believe progress takes time and that the most direct way for us to impact change is to vote. Is it possible to still convince them to vote? Honestly we live in a solidly blue state so it\u2019s not like we won\u2019t end up voting blue anyway. Not sure if this violates any rule but I would like to see more progressive voices in office and to see my friends decide to not vote is frustrating. \n\nEdit: I am not a perfect and moral person. I am just a privileged, regular, uninteresting person of the masses, safely tucked away in a blue bubble. My friends and I can probably survive another four years of red, but I know that many of my peers in battleground/red states would not. Regrettably, harm reduction is the norm of American politics. \n\nWe do not live in a fantasy world where our entire system burns to the ground and my friends and their sympathizers emerge from the flames as rebels to rebuild a new democracy. I don\u2019t believe that is what they truly want. As some have mentioned, my friends are people who have lost (or never had) faith in the system. It has failed and disappointed them, so I don\u2019t blame them for their anger. \n\nI value my friends and I understand their decision to not participate in the two party system. It makes more sense for me to instead seek out those who do not typically vote, and to support campaigns that I am interested in. \n\nI appreciate the many thoughtful responses and thank those who supplied links and articles. Conversation is the way to understanding and I hope people continue to conduct respectful discussions about this topic.",
