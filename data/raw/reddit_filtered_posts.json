According to the settlement, ABC News will pay $15 million as a charitable contribution to a \"Presidential foundation and museum to be established by or for Plaintiff, as Presidents of the United States of America have established in the past.\" Additionally, the network will pay $1 million in Trump's attorney fees. \u00a0\n\nStephanopoulos and ABC News will issue statements of \"regret\" as an editor's note at the bottom of a March 10, 2024, online article, about comments made earlier this year that prompted Trump to file a defamation lawsuit.\u00a0\n\n\"ABC News and George Stephanopoulos regret statements regarding President Donald J. Trump made during an interview by George Stephanopoulos with Rep. Nancy Mace on ABC\u2019s This Week on March 10, 2024,\" the statement reads.\u00a0\n\nTrump filed a defamation suit against Stephanopoulos after he asserted that Trump was found \"liable for rape\" in a civil case during a contentious interview with Rep. Nancy Mace, R-S.C., last March.\n\nAfter playing a clip of Mace discussing being a victim of rape, Stephanopoulos asked her, \"How do you square your endorsement of Donald Trump with the testimony we just saw?\"\u00a0\n\n\"You've endorsed\u00a0Donald Trump\u00a0for president. Judges and two separate juries have found him liable for rape and for defaming the victim of that rape,\" Stephanopoulos said, alluding to the legal victory by Trump accuser E. Jean Carroll.\u00a0\n\nStephanopoulos repeated that claim ten times during his spat with Mace, despite the fact that a jury actually determined Trump was liable for \"sexual abuse,\" which has a distinct definition under New York law.\n\nAfter the federal jury found Trump liable for sexual abuse, but not rape, Judge Lewis Kaplan wrote in a later ruling that just because Carroll failed to prove rape \"within the meaning of the New York Penal Law does not mean that she failed to prove that Mr. Trump \u2018raped\u2019 her as many people commonly understand the word \u2018rape.\u2019\"",

        "text": "The Trump derangement syndrome was truly real with me in 2016- I spent the entire day after the election in bed, hungover and crying. I thought our country was over, I was terrified for the safety of my Jewish husband, and I was telling my gay friends to get married in case their marriage rights were stripped during Trump\u2019s administration. \n\nBut in 2020 I started to rethink things. Me and 8 million other New Yorkers were confined to our tiny apartments indefinitely. We had cops driving cars through our parks, telling people to sit 6 feet away from each other, while my peers praised their \u201cDaddy Cuomo\u201d for doing what they viewed Trump wasn\u2019t willing to do. I watched protestors tear up our city- many of the same people who professed their loved for \u201cDaddy Cuomo\u201d- saying the actions of the protestors were just because the existential threat of systemic racism was far greater than the risk of Covid. I watched those same people dance in the streets when Biden won the election. Meanwhile, I had been laid off twice at that point in 2020 because of crowd restrictions in public places, and was another month away from being laid off for a third time because of the spike of Covid cases in December of 2020. \n\nSince Biden has been elected and since his first magic trick of giving us all $1200 and then devaluing all our money by 2-3%, life here in NYC has steadily declined. I know people assaulted in the streets and on the subway. Our mayor has indicted for corruption. I grocery shop at Walmart in NJ because even the lowest quality foods in the city are ridiculously expensive. It\u2019s $20 for a cocktail around here these days. A friend of mine who opened a business here  18 months ago expected to spend $200k to flip the space, build inventory, and hire staff ended up spending $1m instead because of inflation. Meanwhile we have immigrants who came here because they wanted over the last 4 years living in Midtown Manhattan hotels- where any average New Yorker would have to pay $4-6k a month, having their groceries paid for or complaining when their free food isn\u2019t good enough. We have children who are graduating high school without basic reading and mathematical skills despite our school district spending $21,000 on every student per year. \n\nMeanwhile we are being told constantly by left leaning media that the economy has never been better. We were told Biden was sprightly and ready for four more years even though we could all see with our eyes he was deteriorating. Kamala was heavily disliked amongst my fellow liberals on July 20th but was now the hero everyone was asking for on July 21st. Now as she\u2019s campaigning she\u2019s telling people we can\u2019t have four more years of this and my colleagues nod and yassify her- even though we all know the last four years WERE HER. How am I the only person amongst the Democrats I know who sees this? \n\nEnough is enough of the gaslighting by the legacy media and I\u2019m fed up with being told to not trust my own eyes. I\u2019m sick of being told by celebrities who to vote for, while they released that insipid \u201cImagine\u201d video they made during 2020 from the comfort of their Malibu estates while I and many others were on the phone with unemployment for hours, making sure we could get money so we didn\u2019t lose our homes during a global pandemic.   I hope that many other liberals this year will see how we\u2019ve been played and will attempt to stop the cycle, like me.",

        "text": "Im a minority women, a catholic, and lifelong conservative who currently lives in Manhattan. I went to see President Trump at MSG on Sunday. It was my first political rally/event of any kind. Here are some of my observations and take aways if you're interested so you dont have to rely on the media (sorry its long)!\n\nFirst and foremost WOW! Omgggg the turnout! I severely underestimated his level of support here. I figured i could leave an hour before and walk in to get a seat. No, lol. When I registered for tickets it said the event started at 7, I planned on leaving at 6. So at 445 when i see an article that trump takes the stage at 5, i jump off the couch and skeedaddle over. Luckily i live close to msg. I bought a cute hat and sweatshirt to wear. First time in my life ive worn anything remotely political, but i thought it was important to show that there are full on supporters and not just rally observers in nyc. Also a note that the crowd greatly filled in for a good 2 hours after me. I think the 7pm messaging kept a lot of ppl including me from coming earlier.\n\nI arrive at 515pm. Theres hundreds of cops as the streets outside msg are blocked off. An officer tells me they stopped letting ppl into msg a long time ago, but there are multiple sectioned off areas outside where we can watch on a screen. So i head to the closest area. Tulsi Gabbard is speaking (love her and her evolution \ud83e\udd0d). I join the crush of people and after an hour im able to scooch all the way up to the corner of 7th/fashion ave. Its PAKCED. You cant move, crammed in. People around me talked about getting in line 4, 5, 6 hours early and still not getting inside. Then i found out some people showed up the night before and camped out! \n\nHad it not been for the ppl in the crowd i would have just gone home. Bc the screen was blocked by a tree (multiple crowd chants to MOVE THAT TREE lol) and you could hardly hear a thing (except dana white\ud83d\ude06). Many ppl watching along on their phone for volume. But the vibe was unmatched. Hard to describe. So much enthusiasm. All creeds/colors. Everyone chatting and joking with the ppl around them. In front of me a boomer teamster chatting with a young arab kid draped in an American flag and his mom, and he joked with a gen z hispanic supporter on his other side the rest of the night. Multiply by 100. Everyone was just happy. It was a super communal atmosphere. Cheesy but true. Multiple comments about anger and outrage not being present here. Also the weather was really nice.\n\nFor the first half the crowd was about an even 50/50 split- half white half various shades of black and brown. DO NOT let anyone tell you minorities hate trump. Harris might take more of the overall minority vote than trump but i think we'll see the highest recorded numbers of minorities voting for trump than any other republican candidate in history. Same with the overall NYC and NY vote counts. Surprising to me were the insanely high numbers of orthodox and non orthodox jews. Even jewish people were talking about it. When i arrived id say at least, at least 20% of the crowd was outwardly jewish meaning identifiable dress or adornments, so the actual number was likely way higher. Also very surprising to me were the number of arab supporters. Saw palestine for trump signs. I didnt expect to see that. For the first time ever i saw a significant number of east asians in trump gear. Mostly men but a few women came with them. Also shocking the number of EASL chinese immigrants who showed up. All aged 50s+. Under represented were indian people. I saw a couple young guys in maga hats who looked like your average crypto bros. Saw 0 indian women. Also slightly underrepresented imo given the location...hispanics. Im told lots of hispanic supporters inside but outside the jewish supporters easily outnumbered hispanic by a large margin. At least where i was standing, but it didnt look different when i had to walk through the crowd to leave. To note the jewish orthodox supporters left early, many did not stay through the log jam of speakers, but I can confirm they were there early and in huge numbers. Black men showed up for trump, but I only saw 3 black women. The crowd was about 60-70% millennial/gen z aka under 40 with significant gen z representation. I saw 1 child. About a 60/40 split of men/women. I asked everyone around me where they were from. Was pleasantly surprised it was mostly the 5 boroughs. 2nd after that was LI. One guy came down from Boston.  I didnt meet anyone from NJ which I thought i would have.\n\nThere was only 1 agitator in the crowd. I think white guy with a small sign that simply said \"34 convictions\". He got a couples laughs and boos, but it was all very lighthearted and jokey. No one was aggressive, rude, or vulgar with him and he stayed longer than i did lol.\n\nI stayed for 3.5 hours. My phone died otherwise i probably would have stayed until trump finished speaking even though i couldnt hear him. Im really glad i got to experience a rally. I would absolutely go again, and I would go early to try and get a seat. Chatting with a couple other attendees we discussed how no other politician from any party could draw such a crowd and amount of enthusiasm like this in nyc. Not a single one. Love him or hate him, trump has the IT factor and ppl show up to witness it. \n\nLastly I'll end with snippets of my convos and those around me. Gave me a really interesting perspective on why people from such different backgrounds showed up and are voting for trump.\n\nMan, chinese, 50s-ish, EASL Queens- \n>biden voter but \"kamala is just too far left\". However hes greatly concerned about tariffs as tariffs \"raise prices\" and \"theyre very hard to remove once theyre in place\"\n\nGen z arab american LI- \n>\"i was always liberal until i did my own research. One of my friends is super liberal now every time i go over to her house shes mad at me\"\n\nJewish lady 50s Brooklyn- \n>appalled at bidens stance on gaza and also appalled at the abandonment of hurricane helene victims by the federal govt\n\nMany first time jewish trump voters discussing the obvious reason: \n>Gaza/anti semitism. And again i really need to drive home not only the presence of jewish voters but the ENTHUSIASM they had. Most around me were livestreaming their attendance. \n\nBlack gen z son and his black probably gen x father-\n>\"HELL YEA we love trump\"   \n\nTwo very young jewish girls behind me about 18-21ish Brooklyn (so young i had to explain to them who hulk hogan was lol)- \n>\"i just said i dont want to marry anyone super political and now here i am at a trump rally\" as they erupted in giggles\" \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\udc99\n\nWhite guy 50s queens- \n>\"we just want even tariffs\" also said \"why not give him a shot cant be worse than what we just had\"\n\nDiscussion between multiple gen z/millenial asian and hispanic men and 1 black man (bronx/manhattan/possibly other boroughs)-\n>about how no one voted for her and how you dont deserve to be the pres nominee on a ticket if youve never won a primary and how tulsi gabbard ended her last pres bid over marijuana.\n\nGen z hispanic kid Manhattan- \n>\"if she wins this country is cooked\"\n\n\nI know theres more but honestly im forgetting already bc it happened on sun. Oh and i was only heckled once. When i left i was waiting at the light to cross. This lady next to me was staring, i thought for a cab. Nope, at my hat. She was like YOU HAVE GOT TO BE KIDDING ME. Then she went off about it isnt worth it, my life, my rights, hes a fascist, i cant believe it etc etc... I actually felt bad for her, she sincerely sounded distraught. I just told her things would be ok then kept moving. Honestly though, im not sure shes ok.\n\nEnjoy some pics and videos of my view and ps thats me in the TRUMP WAS RIGHT ABOUT EVERYTHING hat. Covered my face tho bc reddit is unhinged lmao \ud83d\udc80\n\nGuys, if im lying im dying! If you get the opportunity to attend a rally, i highly suggest it. It was fun, positive, and i left feeling really hopeful \u2764\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf2 \n\nVideos linked here bc reddit wont let me upload them:\n\n[WE WANT TRUMP!](https://vimeo.com/1024446361?share=copy)\n\n[Our president finally takes the stage!](https://vimeo.com/1024443515?share=copy)",

But here we are, the day after election day, with him having won nearly half the vote in two deeply blue liberal strongholds. A 60/40 split in such a blue state is a remarkable achievement in today's political climate. This should be looked at as something that proves there is a massive shift coming in American politics. It's already started, and hopefully it cannot be stopped. This is what happens when we get out and vote, we make a lasting impression even when we don't win a state.",
