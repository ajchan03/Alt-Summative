The final package was agreed to by all parties and signed off on by McConnell as well as Democratic leaders before Trump publicly came out against it and urged his allies in the House and Senate GOP to kill it. The reason, according to widespread reporting including the above, was that he wanted to run his campaign on there being chaos at the border and him being the solution to fix it, and he worried that the proposed bill would resolve the problem and deprive him of something to run on. \n\nSince then, Trump has made immigration and the idea of a border crises the central point of his campaign. He's gone to every border state to rant about it and lambast Democrats for not fixing it. He's brought it up in every appearance, at every interview, at the presidential debate. He's tied the border to false stories about migrants coming over to eat people's pets. He brings it up at every rally.

However, since that event, nearly all of the 3rd party/undecided vote have moved to Harris with Trump staying about the same as he was or slipping a point.\n\nIf Trump was up 45-42 on Biden and Harris on July 22, now Trump is still around 45 with Harris at 47. That would mean that as the 3rd party/undecided vote fell, Harris benefited by scooping up the vast majority of those who either preferred third party or were undecided (ignoring non-voters). Trump didn't maintain his edge over Harris since the movable vote didn't split between him and her.\n\nWhy do you think that most of the third party and undecided vote moved to Harris rather than splitting their votes? Is it just because Harris is new despite the fact that most voters disapproved of Harris as VP before she became the nominee? Can Harris get away with not answering reporters' questions or sitting for an interview? Did Trump stumble by not focusing his attack on her left-wing record? Did the Trump campaign misfire by arguing over Walz's military record/stolen valor claims as they aren't dispositive to voters' concerns? Will Harris lose her shine as voters get to know her more and recalibrate the election to a toss-up race?

One of these ways is through the FDA. \n\nPreviously, FDA authorization of Mifepristone aka the abortion pill couldn't be rolled back due to the protections of Roe v. Wade. However, with Roe gone and thus abortion no longer protected nationally thanks to Trump's own Supreme Court appointees, Trump is now free to install any zealot, radical or fundamentalist he chooses as head of the Department of Health and Human Services **(HHS)**, the Food and Drug Administration **(FDA)** and others to pursue federal action like this, as a lot of the remaining means to protect or curtail access go through these types of agencies.

Or is he opening the door to national policy and things like prosecuting women if they get an abortion out-of-state while being registered to a state that has a ban in place?\n\nAnother interesting thing to consider is that Republican policies on abortion have so far typically avoided prosecuting women directly and focused on penalizing doctors instead. When Trump talks about those that violate abortion bans in general though, without stating doctors specifically, he could be opening the door to a sea change on the right where they move towards imprisoning the women themselves. This is something Trump has alluded to before, as far back as 2016 https://www.vox.com/2016/3/30/11333472/trump-abortions-punishment-women.

Ancient Russian history \\[prior to USSR\\], the USSR itself and its development, and the voluntary dissolution of USSR. \n\nThe second portion was about dissolution of USSR by Gorbachev and his belief that it could develop just like the rest of the Europe and U.S. as partners and the Russian expectations. that U.S. was a friend. He concluded that USSR was misled into dissolving Russia. Also, its desire to become a part of the NATO was rejected. \n\nThe final portion related to the U.S. desire to expand NATO to Ukraine beginning in 2008; the coup in Ukraine instigated by the U.S. leading to annexation of Crimea by Russia; The February 22, 2022, incursion to the suburbs of Kiev and in March of 2022 an agreement by representatives of Ukraine and Russia in Istanbul that Ukraine would remain neutral, Crimea will stay Russia Donetsk will remain a part of Ukraine, but with some autonomy where the Russian speakers will be respected.    \n\nPutin noted that as a part of the deal before it was initialed included Kiev's request that Russian withdraw from the Kiev area. Which Putin explained they fully complied with. However, that Boris Johnson along with backing from the U.S. told Zelensky not to agree with the deal. So, the war continues and will continue until the denazification of Ukraine.  Putin noted what is happening in Ukraine is akin to civil war, we are the same people. And that the U.S. goal to weaken Russia will never be accomplished, but that Russia was always ready to negotiate. \n\nScattered here and there were discussion of weakening of the dollar, its use as weapon the growth of BRICS and the Nord Stream Pipelines.

Harris also talked of her plan to address the nation\u2019s housing shortage including increased housing \\[3 millions by end of firsts term\\]. As well as 25,000 down payments for first time home buyer. Referring to the American Rescue Plan\u2019s child tax credit increase to $3,600, up from $2,000, and call for it to be made permanent \\[occurred once in 2021\\]. She also attacked Trump's sales tax \\[dubbed tariffs\\] and Tax cuts to the super rich. She called her own plan an economic opportunity and the support it has garnered. She said Donald has no plan except for himself and a bunch of grievances.  \n\nShe also touched on immigration and abortion rights responding to the questions and blamed Trump \\[hand selected 3 Supreme Court Justices\\]. She also referred to Project 2025 to which Trump denied he ever looked at it.\n\nOn OBAMA Care, Trump said he did not approve of it, but acknowledged he did not have a plan but had a concept in his head about how to replace it. Harris noted he tried to overturn it 60 times.  \n\nTrump promised to enact an efficiency commission to reduce government spending. At the same time, he said he intends to repeal Biden\u2019s tax hikes for tackling inflation and end what he called Biden\u2019s \u201cwar\u201d on American energy production. He also promised to stop Social Security Benefits tax. Trump said he will create the greatest economy in the world. He stated that under the Biden economy people are dying because they cannot afford bacon and eggs.\n\nTrump appeared frustrated with Harris hard hitting responses and he began calling Harris names such as a Marxist, called her father a Marxist too \\[he was a professor of economics\\] He added she is letting criminals in.  To which Harris noted she is the only one on the stage who has prosecuted transnational drug dealers, she noted that Trump called his friends in Congress to kill the bipartisan immigration bill for his talking point. Trump's come back was that the immigrants were killing and eating the pets. The panel rejected that as false on the stage having talked to the mayor of the locality at issue. \n\nTrump was questioned about his mass deportation plan, and he said yes, he would do it sending federal law enforcements, local police and national guard door to door to deport 11 million plus people. He also defended the people who rioted on January 6, 2021, claiming they were singled out. \n\nHe added he had nothing to do with the riot \\[he wanted peaceful protest\\]. In the end he blamed Nancy Pelosi. Harris in her response held Trump responsible for the insurrection and interjected Charlottesville during the conversation. When asked if he now acknowledges he lost the 2020 election, Trump denied on the stage he ever lost the election though he said, he lost by a whisker earlier during the week.  \n\nAs to wars Trump said it would never happen if he were in charge and that he could stop the Ukraine war before he even enters office.  Harris said Trump would just surrender Ukraine and that she believed in Ukraine's integrity and that she supported NATO. As to Afghanistan, Harris asserted Trump made the weakest deal to withdraw.  \n\nOn Climate change Harris noted that Trump has called it a hoax. Harris is said to have called it an existential threat and referred to the greatest legislation addressing climate change that the administration passed.  \n\nOn question of race and color Harris seemed to have hit a home run and recited Trump's history of race bating. Harris instead talked of unity and strength of diversity and how to help all Americans instead of dividing it...   \n\nDid one or the other candidate effectively establish a credible plan to appeal to the undecided voters in the swing states?\n\n[Watch Live: Harris and Trump face off in their first presidential debate, hosted by ABC News (youtube.com)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GBklYSzOGk)\n\n[WATCH LIVE: Harris and Trump debate \u2014 PBS News simulcast of ABC\u2019s 2024 Presidential Debate (youtube.com)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pJrIOey7OQ)",

Some analysts believe the Florida Supreme Court could try something similar soon. So it looks like Republicans could be using some of these states to sort of test run the perfect language they could then apply to a national ban.\n\nAnother interesting point is that Republicans are filing all these things under a 'budget' proposal. This could be because budgetary items can bypass the Senate Filibuster (the minority party veto that the GOP enjoy using when out of power). Special exemptions past it apply to budgets, so all they'd need to do is clear it with the Senate Parliamentarian and they could jam it home with 1-seat majorities in the House and Senate + Trump to sign.

Most importantly out of all of them, and the most likely tipping point state, is Pennsylvania.  But as Harris\u2019s lead has continued to grow, more states have come back into play and are considered battle ground states, including GA, AZ, and NC.  Some polling has also suggested some competitiveness in TX and FL. Michigan also is considered a battle ground state but remains on the Democrat leaning side of the tipping point states.  \n\nWith a candidate who is still introducing herself to new voters and with a finite amount of resources and time, should Harris focus on the tipping point states since that\u2019s all that is needed to win or should she expanding her campaign to cover all battle ground states?\n\nReasons to focus on the tipping point states are because those will most likely win you the election.  There is only so much money and time and Harris doesn\u2019t want to lose these states.  As Biden lost ground in the polls there were questions on whether he should campaign in states that became competitive like NM and VA but at that point if he\u2019s losing that much then the race is already lost.\n\nReasons to focus on battle ground states include polling error and shifts in the race. Harris is leading in WI but that state has been notoriously difficult to poll with very high polling errors.  This could be true for any state.  Harris does not want to get caught like Hillary not campaigning in a state that she thought was completely safe only based on polls.  Also for coat tail reasons.  If Harris can help other democrats gets over the finish line in more states, the better. North Carolina and Texas remain dreams for democrats and that\u2019s a long game that democrats need to put effort towards over decades.",

        "text": "On the prospect of a purge of top generals and admirals by the incoming Trump administration, to ensure personal loyalty to him....\n\nThis matter has been debated frequently on Reddit. However, I have some niche experience in this realm, having helped maintain Wikipedia's articles listing [four-star](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_active_duty_United_States_four-star_officers) (admirals and generals) and [three-star](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_active_duty_United_States_three-star_officers) (vice admirals and lieutenant generals) officers in the United States military since late 2020.\n\nMilitary officer appointment procedures stem from the [Defense Officer Personnel Management Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defense_Officer_Personnel_Management_Act) (DOPMA), passed in 1980, and are codified in Title 10 of the [United States Code](https://uscode.house.gov/browse/&edition=prelim). When the Armed Services committees pass their yearly defense authorisation bill, any changes demanded of the military consist of updates to Title 10. Officers are appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate.\n\nWhile the military is *supposed* to be apolitical, senior officers can, and have been, removed at the President's pleasure. After all, ultimately, *the President decides who they want to work with, and senior officers are vetted partially on how well they could work with the commander in chief.* Recent removals have occurred when the individual expresses open disagreement with the commander in chief, makes severe public gaffes, or are unlucky enough to commit professional incompetence ([Moseley 2008](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/the-undoing-of-gen-t-mich_b_238432), [McChrystal 2010](https://www.bbc.com/news/10395402), [Mattis 2013](https://foreignpolicy.com/2013/01/18/the-obama-administrations-inexplicable-mishandling-of-marine-gen-james-mattis-2/)). Since the main duty of senior officers outside command is to present honest military advice to the commander-in-chief, and to Congress, relieving them before the end of their assignments is unexpected and risks the wrath of their retired colleagues and their supporters in Congress.\n\nBefore I enter my initial opinions for discussion, here are some stats (accurate as of 9 November 2024). Of the four-star officers currently on active duty (44 in total):\n\n1. **9** are African-American (including Chairman of the Joint Chiefs [CQ Brown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Q._Brown_Jr), the principal military advisor to the President).\n2. **6** were initially promoted to four-star general or admiral under the Trump administration (one, [GEN LaCamera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_LaCamera), is retiring with a Senate-confirmed successor already in place).\n3. **3** are women, all initially appointed by the Biden administration, and the first woman appointed to each of their roles, received a lot of publicity ([ADMs Franchetti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisa_Franchetti), [Fagan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linda_L._Fagan), and [Levine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rachel_Levine)).\n4. **1** serves in a non-military political office that can hold the rank of admiral in the Public Health Service if desired ([ADM Levine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rachel_Levine), the first openly transgender person to hold the rank of admiral).\n\nHere is what I surmise based on my personal experience, and what other articles have already stated:\n\n* The incoming administration will target generals and admirals too closely identified with their predecessor's DEI initiatives. Here are the most likely departures:\n   * ADM Levine, who isn't technically military, serves in a political role (Assistant Secretary for Health) and only holds military rank to outrank the [three-star surgeon general](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vivek_Murthy), is easily the first one out.\n   * Gen Brown, [chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chairman_of_the_Joint_Chiefs_of_Staff). [George Floyd](https://www.americanrhetoric.com/speeches/charlesqbrownongeorgefloydcivilunrest.htm) (iykyk). The chairman of the Joint Chiefs served a 2-year term by law, typically renewed once by the President with Senate confirmation, until it was changed in 2017 to an uninterrupted 4-year term. Brown may simply be relieved prematurely at his 2-year halfway mark, October 2025.\n   * ADM Franchetti, the first woman to be [chief of naval operations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_of_Naval_Operations) (head of the Navy). Her selection as the CNO was highly publicized, following the 2021 promotions of [GEN Richardson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laura_J._Richardson), [Gen Van Ovost](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacqueline_Van_Ovost), and ADM Fagan (Richardson and Van Ovost have retired). However, the President made the call to [choose Franchetti](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/lisa-franchetti-nominated-first-woman-navy-joint-chiefs-of-staff/), [overruling the DOD's pick](https://www.politico.com/news/2023/06/12/paparo-franchetti-austin-navy-00101594), thus giving the incoming administration a possible opening.\n* For those worrying about blatantly \"Trumpist\" generals being appointed, I don't see that happening without a sudden culture shift in the military. Not soon, anyway.\n   * For starters, the tradition that the military stay out of partisan politics is sacrosanct. I haven't seen any  recent cases where an active duty military officer (including [LTG Mike Flynn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Flynn)) paraded around any partisan leanings. While the military's values typically lean traditional Republican, open loyalty to a President typically shows only after retirement.\n   * If the President-elect is serious about appointing \"loyal\" officers to senior military roles, he'll have to comb the lower ranks. [Title 10, Section 601](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/10/601) of the U.S. Code stipulates that only one-star officers and above can be promoted to general or admiral, so the maximum he could do is promote colonels and Navy captains to one-star ranks and begin choosing from there.\n   * On the \"culture shift\", open, public loyalty to a President from the upper military brass (the kind we likely worry about) will only show once the practice becomes either legally acceptable or murky enough on paper to no longer be important.\n   * To dismiss disloyal officers and comb the lower ranks for desired ones will likely require a special commission to investigate. The military officers and DOD professionals (smth smth [Schedule F](https://protectdemocracy.org/work/trumps-schedule-f-plan-explained/)) in charge of vetting prospective senior officers for the secretaries of the Army, Navy, and Air Force, JCS chairman, Secretary of Defense and President would have no clue on how to select based on the \"loyalty\" the President-elect desires.\n* The President, and allied defense advisors, may try to replace DOPMA or loosen its requirements so officers from lower ranks can be promoted faster to reach the upper brass, or increase the maximum retirement age of 64 to keep favoured officers for as long as possible (not unheard of - [the DOD under Rumsfeld tried to increase it to 72](https://books.google.com.sg/books?id=mUqr4c4-VXMC&pg=PA1491&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false)). Senate confirmation will remain part of the process, but a pliant majority until at least 2027 should make it a breeze.\n\nr/Military focuses on topics like military pay, veterans' benefits, the state of military barracks, and on the political side, how the incoming administration will affect the willingness of the rank-and-file to continue military service. This community often provides more analytical insights, so I look forward to it.\n\nOnce again, this matter has been debated frequently in other areas on Reddit, but I hope I've provided additional insight so productive responses are forthcoming. Maybe there's cause for concern, maybe there isn't - i.e. only a few officers will see termination. We won't know until he takes office. What do you think?\n\nP.S. Sorry if I sound abrasive in this post. I've been described as having a stiff and formal manner of speaking.\n\nP.P.S. The military being used for partisan purposes with a purge of senior officers is inherently a political matter. The jargon-heavy nature of this post hopefully doesn't change that.\n\nP.P.P.S. If this question looks partisan in any way whatsoever, I apologise and am welcome to receive comments on how I can reword portions to be less disparaging in nature.\n\n**Sources:**\n\n* [Pentagon anticipates major upheaval with Trump\u2019s return to White House](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2024/11/07/trump-military-pentagon/)\n* [Pentagon officials anxious Trump may fire the military\u2019s top general](https://www.politico.com/news/2024/11/08/pentagon-trump-fire-cq-brown-00188536)\n* [Trump may further test US military norms in second term](https://sg.news.yahoo.com/trump-may-further-test-us-103848814.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAJqlR_aGl96mZC_C8cWCysgr-4KIYRg-6c9YlCYN4LwjNBoy3lcPjkbGd3mZaBra5tRwoeImhrekyHSBuARDOaVxAo2b0yEEfdLCBMcJiGiRiIZExHKIY4fSbghBzW-rUCKQ-akYkQ22B0aj2QYjtGflCxuuqBj27Rd9ALcw3QFA)\n* [Legislative history of United States four-star officers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legislative_history_of_United_States_four-star_officers) (Wikipedia article - this is a TL;DR, there are individual articles for certain eras which one should read if time permits)",

She serves on The Committee of Oversight and Reform, which is the main investigative committee in the House. In January 2023, she was selected as the Vice Ranking Member \u2014 the #2 spot for Democrats on the committee. She also serves as a first-time member on The Committee on Natural Resources and as Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on Energy and Mineral Resources. Since her first election, she has become one of the most high-profile Democrats in the House. She is considered a left-wing Democrat. She is 35 years old.\n\nChuck Schumer is a member of the United States Senate, the senior senator from New York, and the current Majority Leader and Chair of the Senate Democratic Caucus. He was first elected to the Senate in the 1998 midterms, and has won reelection four times. Prior to that, he was a member of the House of Representatives for the state of New York, first elected in 1980. Schumer has served on numerous committees and other official functions in both the House and the Senate. He is 74 years old.\n\nIt is widely agreed that Schumer cannot be primaried, due to his popularity and political longevity. Prospective contenders will have to wait until he leaves office. Schumer does not plan to retire at the moment. New York has been a blue state for decades. Whoever the Democratic candidate is, is expected to be elected. Therefore, the real contest will be the Democratic primary, not the election. Schumer ascended to the Senate from the House. If he chooses to retire when his term is up, in 2028, AOC will then have 10 years of experience in the House and be 39, which would make her a good contender to succeed him. However, questions remain about her ability to widen her appeal from New York's 14th Congressional District to the entire state. Roughly 64% of the state's population lives in the New York City metropolitan area and 40% in New York City alone. New York City Democrats are more progressive than upstate Democrats, who tend to be moderates.\n\nDoes Rep. Ocasio-Cortez stand a chance of winning the Democratic primary to designate Schumer's successor when he retires?",

Even a large number of Latino voters, a community that are overwhelmingly immigrant related, voted for Trump for this same reason.  While its understandable that immigrants also have the mentality of \"deport criminals, keep the hard working ones\" just as Americans do, the fact that a large portion of the populace associates high immigration with high crime is still unexplainable to me.\n\nAnd also; how much of this is the fault of Harris' campaign oversight? As well as DNC negligence. Similar to the economy, we have a situation here where statistics and data shows that immigration and the economy are doing good, but unlike the economy, immigration crime doesn't at all affect most Americans, there's just a perception that isn't even truly there. The Harris campaign could've flagshipped \"immigrants commit less crimes than citizens, also they're good for reducing inflation\", yet didn't. So how are these numbers of the positives of immigration not at all mainstream? \n\nPeople are still espouting myths of immigration crime and their impacts of the economy, I'm shocked that numbers-based facts haven't been shown to the public to say \"hey guys, we hear you, but all of your concerns would be fixed if we legalized them and taxed them more. I PROMISE you guys, immigrants are not increasing crime in this country, the FBI has the numbers to back this up.\" This should've been the flagship and the Harris Campaign could've equally spent time educating the public about the truth of immigration. Yet that didn't seem to be the case.\n\nSo I have to ask: why aren't these facts commonplace? For what reason is it that the DNC never articulated and lead with immigration statistics when convincing the public that immigration is not the problem?\n\n**Edit:** Several people without reading this post are trying to correct me by saying \"illegal immigrants commit more crimes, pundits are referring to illegal immigrants when they talk about the high immigration crime.\" Please reconsider posting if you intend on being confidently incorrect and haven't even read this post.

        "text": "With the upcoming 2024 election, there\u2019s a growing concern about what might happen if Trump loses again. We all remember January 6, 2021, when a violent mob stormed the Capitol. This event didn\u2019t just happen out of the blue\u2014Trump\u2019s rhetoric played a significant role in inciting it.\n\nIn the days leading up to January 6, Trump repeatedly claimed the election was stolen, despite no evidence supporting these claims. During his speech on January 6, Trump told his supporters: \u201cWe fight like hell. And if you don\u2019t fight like hell, you\u2019re not going to have a country anymore\u201d.\n\nDuring the 2024 Republican National Convention (RNC), several speeches highlighted the intense rhetoric surrounding the election. Donald Trump, after accepting the GOP nomination, made a passionate speech where he described himself as a fighter against a corrupt establishment. He warned of \u201cchaos and destruction\u201d if he wasn\u2019t re-elected, framing the 2024 election as a battle for the soul of America.\n\nRepublican leaders also echoed this combative tone. J.D. Vance, the vice presidential nominee, emphasized his alignment with Trump, warning of the need to \u201cfight\u201d against perceived threats to American values. These speeches collectively built a narrative of urgency and confrontation, which could fuel concerns about potential unrest if Trump loses in 2024.\n\nAs the 2024 election approaches, the rhetoric from Trump and his supporters has intensified, with some openly threatening violence if he loses. On Truth Social, users have expressed their willingness to take drastic actions, with comments like, \u201cIf they steal the election again, we won\u2019t just march on the Capitol, we\u2019ll take our country back by any means necessary.\u201d \n\nGiven these statements and the current political climate, do you think we\u2019re at risk of another January 6-style event or even a civil war if Trump loses in 2024? What steps can be taken to prevent this from happening again?",

They think Democrats are exaggerating or scaremongering. Same deal with Trump threatening democracy, they think he wouldn't really do it or it could never happen because there are too many safety measures in place. Back in 2016, a lot of people dismissed the idea that *Roe v Wade* might seriously be overturned if Trump is elected, thinking that that was exaggeration as well.\n\nOn the podcast strategist Anat Shenker-Osorio argued that sometimes we have to deliberately *understate* the danger posed by the other side in order to make that danger more credible, and this ties into the current strategy of calling Republicans \"weird\" and focusing on unpopular but credible policies like book bans, etc. Does this strategy make sense, or is it counterproductive to whitewash your opponent's platform for them?

While this is obviously impossible to quantify, I have heard anecdotal accounts of good support for Harris in many of the swing states--better than Clinton or even Biden enjoyed. She is also dominating early voting in Pennsylvania. How do we reconcile that with her poor showing in the polls?",

        "text": "I've been thinking through this after seeing endless amounts of highly upvoted posts touting some new poll showing Harris pulling away. \n\n3 major election models all show Harris as a slight favorite. (538, economist, Nate Silver's model at his sub stack) and Silver has at least said at this point he'd rather be Harris with the polls he is seeing. \n\nHowever we have two very clear data points with Trump on the ballot. In 2016 Trump pulled off a win when almost no one thought he had a chance. And in 2020 Biden had a clear win, but it ended up being *far* closer than the polls. In fact, projections the day before the election were that Biden would score pretty comfortable wins in the Blue wall and also pick up wins in FL and NC. Reviewing the polls of FL in particular shows Biden consistently being up 3-6 points. \n\nhttps://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2020-election-forecast/\n\nFor reference here is the final 538 projection but to summarize it gave Biden a 90% chance to win with likely wins in FL and NC and Iowa and TX being closish. Biden ended up losing FL pretty convincingly, and the polls were off by a good 5 points or so. \n\nCurrently, all polling seems to show a super narrow Harris lead, often within the margin of error, even in the Blue wall states and Trump with clear leads in AZ, FL and more of a toss up in GA and NC. \n\nMy question is:  Is there any objective reason or evidence to believe the polls are *not* once again underestimating Trump's support? They have under called Trump's vote by 3-5 points twice so far, why won't it happen again? I'm not looking for vibes or political reasons to vote a particular way, but more of a discussion on why we should, to be blunt, trust the polls to get it right this time.",

Some media outlets rumoured that they might go through a split.\n\n2. there are videos showing Laura Loomer and Donald Trump very close and familiar to each other and even saying \u201aI love you\u2018 (even if it\u2019s in the context of the election and his \u2018fight\u2019 for America)\n\n3. She traveled with him on his plane to the debate even though she does not officially work for him or his campaign.\n\n4. Some rumours even go that far, stating that Loomer might be pregnant by Trump (showing a baby bump of her) \n\n5. There have been videos of Trump during rallies pointing to Loomer in the crowd and stating how much he likes her and how beautiful, etc she is \n\nEven if these are all just rumours this raises a few questions.\n\nQuestions about the rumour itself:\n\n1. If she doesn\u2019t work for him, why is she travelling with him everywhere? (This could make the impression that they\u2019re dating) \n\n2. If they\u2019re not dating, why are they so touchy with each other? \n\nQuestions about the election:\n\n1. Could this rumour influence how conservatives vote? \n\n2. Also, Loomer is very controversial, even among Trump allies - could she draw an even bigger split in the Republican Party?

Pp. 5\u201343\n\nEarlier in February 2024, a unanimous panel of judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit rejected the former president's argument that he has \"absolute immunity\" from prosecution for acts performed while in office.\n\n\"Presidential immunity against federal indictment would mean that, as to the president, the Congress could not legislate, the executive could not prosecute and the judiciary could not review,\" the judges ruled. \"We cannot accept that the office of the presidency places its former occupants above the law for all time thereafter.\"\n\nDuring the oral arguments in April of 2024 before the U.S. Supreme Court; Trump urged the high court to accept his rather sweeping immunity argument, asserting that a president has absolute immunity for official acts while in office, and that this immunity applies after leaving office. Trump's counsel argued the protections cover his efforts to prevent the transfer of power after he lost the 2020 election.\n\nAdditionally, they also maintained that a blanket immunity was essential because otherwise it could weaken the office of the president itself by hamstringing office holders from making decisions wondering which actions may lead to future prosecutions.\n\nSpecial counsel Jack Smith had argued that only sitting presidents enjoy immunity from criminal prosecution and that the broad scope Trump proposes would give a free pass for criminal conduct.\n\nAlthough Trump's New York 34 count indictment help him raise additional funds it may have alienated some voters.

        "text": "There has been a lot of talk about what limitations Trump will or will not face in imposing his will on America. Some say he will fundamentally transform America into a totalitarian hellscape; others say Trump will be considerably more restrained, if not constrained. There appears to be a spectrum of opinions. I'll set them forth below.\n\n**Extreme One**\n\n> Trump faces no practical limitations anymore. He will be able to stack every facet of the government with sufficient loyalists that he will be able to do literally anything he wants. If he wants to, he could force everyone to hang a painting of himself in their house and have them executed if the painting is damaged. Even if there are laws that prohibit something, Trump will have the power to change or, perhaps worse, simply ignore them because nobody will stand in his way. Those who do stand in his way will be removed from his path, likely brutally. America will transform into an Orwellian nightmare where every device is listening to ensure anyone who so much as whispers something criticism-adjacent will be shot. There will be sham elections in which Trump receives 100% of the vote every time while simultaneously anyone who votes against Trump is literally thrown to a pack of wolves to be ripped apart.\n\n**Middle Position**\n\n> Trump will face some obstacles in trying to implement loony policies. The SCOTUS/Congress/Military would prevent him from mandating really horrifying stuff like what is being suggested above. That being said, many of his policies, such as abolishing the Department of Education, imposing tariffs, and so on, will sail on through. There could be fair and free elections in the future.\n\n**Extreme Two**\n\n> Trump will be a far right president, but nothing more. Democracy will survive, even if Democrats will have a whole lot to complain about. Perhaps the federal bureaucracy is turned to Trump's whims, perhaps it's not; but we will have the rule of law, and we will have fair and free elections moving forward. If a Republican loses in 2028, then a Democrat will become president.\n\nHow likely are each of these three positions to occur? Are all of them incorrect? What alternative positions are there to take?\n\n**EDIT: In light of Trump drafting an Executive Order specifically to purge the military of \"woke\" generals and admirals, it looks like Extreme One is the clear favorite.**",

She has the wind at her back on issues with abortion and democracy.  She\u2019s been out campaigning and out spending trumps campaign.  She has a positive favorability rating which is something rare in today\u2019s politics.  Trump on the other hand has had a long string of bad weeks.  Long gone are the days where trump effectively communicates this as a fight against the political elites and instead it\u2019s replaced with wild conspiracies and rambling monologues.  His favorability rating is negative and 5 points below Harris.  None of the attacks from Trump have been able to stick.  Even inflation which has plagued democrats is drifting away as an issue.  Inflation rates are dropping and the fed is cutting rates.  Even during the debate last night inflation was only mentioned 5 times, half the amount of things like democracy, jobs, and the border.\n\nYet, despite all this the race remains incredibly stable.  Harris holds a steady 3 point lead nationally and remains in a statistical tie in the battle ground states.  If Harris does lose then what do democrats do?  They currently have a popular candidate with popular policies against an unpopular candidate with unpopular policies.  What would the Democratic Party need to do to overcome something that would be clearly systemically against them from winning?  And to the heart of this question, why would Harris lose and what would democrats do to fix it?",

But experts agree that Trump is a [clear threat](https://www.gov.harvard.edu/2024/10/31/steven-levitsky-daniel-ziblatt-publish-op-ed-in-nyt/) to American democracy, not Harris or the Democrats. Why? In his first term, he tried to [overturn](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c93pdlg4dlno) the 2020 election that all [evidence](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2103619118) shows he lost. During his first term he also used the powers of the federal government improperly to [go after](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/12/amazon-claims-trump-blocked-10-billion-defense-contract-because-he-hates-jeff-bezos?srsltid=AfmBOorN76UwttQ_nXMj2DSE9TEa17Jk8XYRudocru8rk1VbrxCXIO2e) his opponents and to try to [sway](https://www.newsweek.com/irs-feared-trump-stimulus-checks-broke-law-1972140) voters. In his campaigning, he has repeatedly praised strongmen like [Putin ](https://www.politico.com/news/2022/02/23/trump-putin-ukraine-invasion-00010923)and Orban and said he wants to emulate them. He has threatened to [punish](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/sep/20/trump-election-opponents-threats) his opponents and to stay in office [past](https://www.politico.com/news/2024/05/18/trump-at-nra-convention-floats-a-three-term-presidency-00158786) a second term. \n\nSo why did the Trump threat to democracy not affect Trump voters?\n\nDo most Trump voters just not care about democracy all that much? Data from [exit polls](https://apnews.com/article/democracy-harris-trump-threats-authoritarianism-election-2024-56b4eb981f34f3e60aec1e45a67fc8a2) suggests that many voters for both Trump and Harris said their vote choice was motivated strongly by appeals to defend democracy. This was the number one reason for most Harris voters, but it was also the first or second most important reason cited for many Trump voters. Surveys also suggest [similar](https://today.yougov.com/politics/articles/48238-most-americans-support-democracy-and-oppose-dictatorship) levels of support for democracy among Democrats and Republicans. However, it is possible that Trump voters are not as committed to democracy even if they say it matters to them in surveys.\n\nAnother possibility is that Trump and Harris supporters just think democracy means different things, and Trump's actions are consistent with how Trump supporters think about democracy. Social science research suggests Republicans and Democrats understand democracy to mean [the same thing](https://theconversation.com/how-different-people-around-the-world-understand-democracy-and-why-it-matters-241617): free and fair elections and political freedoms like free speech. But maybe when you drill down into the details, Trump supporters have different ideas about what makes an election free and fair or which freedoms should be defended.\n\nIt could also be the case that Trump convinced his supporters he is the one defending democracy. If they believe the election in 2020 really was stolen from him, that Democrats are letting immigrants vote for them illegally, and that Trump's prosecutions were political retribution, they might accept the narrative that Trump was persecuted by a corrupt and authoritarian Democratic party. But maybe these beliefs are not deeply held and are just claims made to justify their political project, for which democracy doesn't matter all that much. \n\nIs there another possibility I am missing? \n\nI realize these different explanations will apply to some Trump voters and not others, but what do you think is the most important explanation?",

It is widely regarded as a major health win. The benefit of fluoridated water is to prevent cavities. The HHS has a range on safe levels of Flouride 0.7 milligrams per liter. It is well documented that high level of Flouride consumption (far beyond the ranges set by the HHS) do cause negative health effects. To my knowledge, there is no study that shows adverse effects within normal ranges. The water companies I believe have the responsibility to maintain a normal level range of Flouride. But to summarize, it appears fluoridated water helps keeps its populations teeth cavity free, and does not pose a risk.\n\nHowever, Robert Kennedy claims that fluoridation has a plethora of negative effects.

It specifically states higher level of Flouride consumption and targets specifically the fetus of pregnant women.\n\nhttps://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9922476/\n\n\nI believe kennedy found bone cancer as a link through a 1980 study on osteosarcoma, a very rare form of bone cancer. \n\nhttps://amp.cancer.org/cancer/risk-prevention/chemicals/water-fluoridation-and-cancer-risk.html\n\nWith all this said, if Flouride is removed from the water, a potential compromise is to use the money that was spent to regulate Flouride infrastructure  and instead give Americans free toothpaste.

It\u2019s common to hear varied views, from a lukewarm \u201che\u2019s okay\u201d to worse criticisms about his age and ability. His record, particularly given the circumstances he\u2019s faced, seems to contradict these views. While there were other potential candidates in 2020, his performance has been noteworthy imo. His age is a factor to consider for future terms, but let\u2019s focus on his achievements during his current term:\n\n* The American Rescue Plan has had significant impacts. It has made insurance more affordable for many families, allocated funds for affordable housing, public safety, and crime reduction. It has supported small businesses, expanded food and child care programs, invested in mental health centers, and provided assistance to families with children. It has also set aside $40 billion for American workers. Thanks to this plan, child poverty is now half of what it was. These areas have seen increased funding after years of underinvestment.\n\n* A $1 trillion infrastructure bill was passed to repair roads, waterways, bridges, and railroads, and to bring high-speed internet to rural areas. It includes funds for public transit and airports, electric vehicles and low emission public transportation, power infrastructure, and clean water. This aims to revamp the US infrastructure, a move not seen since the days of LBJ and FDR.\n\n* [The Inflation Reduction Act](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/themes/whitehouse/assets/img/record/inflation-reduction-act-50.png).\n\n* Employment is at an all-time high. 2021 and 2022 saw the strongest years of job growth in history. Nearly 11 million jobs have been created since he took office \u2013 including 750,000 manufacturing jobs. The unemployment rate is at a 50-year low. The American economy is performing surprisingly well compared to other major economies, showing a strong rebound from the pandemic. A record number of small businesses have started since he took office. However, inflation remains a concern.\n\n* In terms of foreign policy: 1. He withdrew from Afghanistan. The execution had its challenges and the aftermath was complex, but many argue that the outcome was likely inevitable. This was a step that previous administrations had promised but never implemented. 2. He navigated a complex geopolitical conflict against a nuclear power that threatened the global order. This was the first time since World War II that a European state annexed the territory of another. At a time when allies were questioning their relationship with the US and when American influence seemed to be decreasing (France, Saudi, India, China, etc.), he managed to strengthen these alliances and coordinate a swift response against Russia, while providing support to Ukraine.\n\n* His ability to pass legislation is notable and is likely due to his extensive experience and the respect he commands from both sides of the aisle. This respect is built on decades of bipartisanship and close relationships.\n\n* Additional achievements include: climate change legislation, antitrust measures, the chips act, gun legislation, student debt relief, pardoning certain federal offenses, a diverse administration, increased health insurance coverage, and support for unions.\"\n\nGiven these achievements, why are his ratings so low? I had made a more \"opinionated\" post on r/thedaily but I cut down much of that to ask here.",

And men the same age favored former President Donald J. Trump by 13 points. **That is a whopping 51-point divide along gender lines, larger than in any other generation.**\u201d\n\nA survey by the University of Michigan shows that this phenomenon is not just present in the 18-29 age range, but in the youth below that range as well. [High school boys are trending conservative.](https://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/4125661-high-school-boys-are-trending-conservative/)\n\nThis could explain why Donald Trump has done dozens of interviews on podcasts, which are a form of media that young men are more drawn to than women (although this gap is much smaller than the party line gap). The Harris campaign has done zero podcasts and at the time of this post, doesn\u2019t seem to have plans to do any. \n\nWhy are Democrats hemorrhaging young men and what can be done, if anything, to mitigate this?",

One of his campaign promises is to start \"the largest deportation in history\" once he takes office. I have so many questions about how he will be able to do this.\n\nAs of 2024, the US currently has 21,000 ICE officers employed throughout the country. How will a staff of this size be able to sweep the country for 10 million migrants? Will they need assistance from the military or national guard and how will they be able to train them to do this? Also, how will they be able to develop the infrastructure for detention of all these migrants? Will they be building camps or using existing prison infrastructure that is already at capacity?\n\nIf Trump is able to get the manpower and resources to do this, it is very unlikely that Mexico and other Latin American countries will just willingly take these people back in. I can see this developing into a large scale humanitarian crisis. What is Trump's plan for this? Long term detention of migrants in camps? Granting them asylum or temporary visas? Dumping them across the border covertly? Forcing Mexico to accept them?\n\nIf the migrants are all gone, who takes the place in society to do the jobs that they do? Does Trump believe that American citizens will be lining up to pick fruit in 100 degree weather for minimum wage? Who will clean hotels, work low level construction labor jobs, pick fruit, etc.?\n\nTher are just so many  questions as to how he can pull this off and I see this being his 2024 version of the 2016 promise of building a wall that Mexico will pay for that never happened.",

US and Israeli intelligence both also report that in addition to the Hamas dead, thousands of other soldiers have been wounded, although they disagree on the severity of these wounds with Israeli intelligence believing most will not return to the battlefield while American intel suggests many eventually will. Hamas are widely reported to have had 25,000-30,000 fighters at the start of the war.\n\nAnother interesting point from the Reuters piece is that Israeli military chiefs and intelligence believe that an invasion of Rafah would mean 6-8 more weeks in total of full scale military operations, after which Hamas would be decimated to the point where they could shift to a lower intensity phase of targeted airstrikes and special forces operations that weed out fighters that slipped through the cracks or are trying to cobble together control in areas the Israeli army has since cleared in the North.\n\nHow do you think this information should shape Israeli's response and next steps? Should they look to move in on Rafah, take out as much of what's left of Hamas as possible and move to targeted airstrikes and Mossad ops to take out remaining fighters on a smaller scale? Should they be wary of international pressure building against a strike on Rafah considering it is the last remaining stronghold in the South and where the majority of Palestinian civilians in the Gaza Strip have gathered, perhaps moving to surgical strikes and special ops against key threats from here without a full invasion?

However, I think it's fun to speculate and then perhaps look back on later to see how predictions pan out.\n\nIf Harris wins this election, then unless something extreme happens, she will run for reelection in 2028. However, should she lose, it appears that Democrats may face the most open primary cycle in a very long time. Obviously there were a few names speculated around the time that Biden dropped out, including but not limited to Gavin Newson, Gretchen Whitmer, Pete Buttigieg, or J.B. Pritzker. Do we think one of these potential candidates could keep momentum going long enough from right now to win a primary in 2028, or do we think that maybe a more up-and-coming player may emerge, perhaps someone younger like a Wes More?\n\nIf Trump wins, he would also be term-limited. It would seem then, logically, that JD Vance would carry that mantle into 2028 (kind of how Harris is for Biden right now). Perhaps he would face an open primary, or maybe the party will rally around him as the heir apparent. I think the more interesting scenario, though, is if Trump loses. His hold on the Republican Party is well-documented at this point, although at age 82 and losing 2/3 presidential elections is pretty damning. Should he want to run yet again, would he even have the support to do so? or would voters reject him for someone new, and who could that possibly be?",

        "text": "As you may have heard, today the Supreme Court handed down a 6-2 (with Justice Jackson having recused herself due to prior involvement) decision along the usual lines that essentially overturns the 40-year old Chevron deference principle. \n\nThe particular case involved a fishery that was being mandated to pay the cost of federal observers on boats, a decision made by the National Marine Fisheries Service to deal with budgetary constraints.\n\nThe Chevron deference principle, as I understand it, allows federal agencies some leeway in how they create and apply rules, where congress has provided no guidance or ambiguous guidance. Even with the Chevron principles, if the law is clear, agencies cannot overrule it. It only matters when there is a gap in congressional directive. The name comes from a case in 1984 where the court at the time established the rules for interpreting agency scope: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevron_U.S.A.,_Inc._v._Natural_Resources_Defense_Council,_Inc.\n\nProponents of the Chevron deference principle claim that it allows agencies to function smoothly and use their expertise -- that neither congress nor the courts is likely to have -- to do their jobs effectively. They believe that the end of Chevron will significantly limit the federal government's ability to do its job as a regulator, threatening all sorts of things, like consumer safety. \n\nCritics say that it gives agencies broad power that is neither constitutional, nor provided by congress. This overreach cannot be checked by the courts and thus emboldens federal agencies to do things that may be beyond the intent of congress and thus of the electorate at large.\n\nHere is the SCOTUS blog summary of the case: https://www.scotusblog.com/2024/06/supreme-court-strikes-down-chevron-curtailing-power-of-federal-agencies/\n\nI would like to see what people think we can expect after today's ruling. Are the pro-Chevron concerns overblown? Or is this a massive change that might usher in a new era of federal government ineffectiveness? What can congress or the president do at this point to resolve the issue? How might this effect the 2024 election?",

As [Vox reported yesterday](https://www.vox.com/policy/24072983/biden-trump-palestinians-israel-gaza-policy-different), \"*Biden has been bad for Palestinians.

        "text": "There have been many conversations about why Harris lost.  However, one of the most compelling ones I\u2019ve found is that Trump was an antiestablishment candidate who promised change against a system that is extremely unpopular.  Democrats were left defending institutions that are unpopular and failed to convince the working class and the majority of Americans that they are on their side.  Democrats never gave the American public the idea of what a new reformed government could look like under Harris.  Trumps cabinet picks have primarily been focused on outsides and victims of the systems that they intend to run.  It\u2019s clear that the appeal here is that Gabbard/RFK/Musk is going to clear out all the unpopular bureaucracy, inefficiencies and poor management of these institutions.  For the most part, Americans are receptive of this message.  Trump was elected by the plurality of the vote.  Musk, RFK, and Rogan all have strong bases of support for being non conventional.  Poll after poll voters have expressed extreme desire for significant change. \n\nAfter listening to Ezra Kleins latest podcast, they aren\u2019t exactly wrong.  Americans don\u2019t trust democrats or the government in power.  California and New York are the two most populous blue states that have the highest amount of people leaving.  People see how projects like a speed rail has wasted billions of dollars and nothing to show for it after decades.  They see how it cost $2 million dollars just to build a toilet.  Despite these two states being economic and societal powerhouses, there\u2019s a reason that people are leaving that politicians are missing.  \n\nBut it\u2019s not just at the state level.  Federal projects end up taking literally years due to the momentous amount of hoops and bureaucracy.  Despite the CHIPS act being passed over 2 years ago, most of the money still hasn\u2019t been spent because of just how inefficient it\u2019s being handled.  Simple things like investing in EVs end up being a confusing mixture of requirements bot h for consumers and companies that constantly moves on a yearly basis.  \n\nI used to think that M4A struggled to gain momentum because of the cost but it\u2019s clear to me now that the hesitation that people have towards it is that they simply do not trust the government to run a system effectively or efficiently.  Thats another reason why gun restrictions may be popular but rarely are motivating because people do not trust the government to enact that laws.  I recall people talking about a government funded childcare and people are immediately worried about all the strings and bureaucracy that comes with it.  It\u2019s a very common joke that anything the government does will be done poorly and take twice as long.  Even when the child tax credit wasn\u2019t renewed because people didnt care enough.  \n\nIf people are so dissatisfied with the government and the status quo, why should democrats expect voters to give them more power?  So what can democrats do to restore the faith of the American public in government?  How can democrats make it take a year to rebuild a bridge, like the I95 collapse, instead of a decade?  What changes should democrats propose to make it clear that government is working for them and if not, can be held accountable?  What can democratic governors do to prevent the mass exodus from their states?",

And that the latter \\[criminal prosecution\\] is not dependent on what does or does not happen during impeachment.  They noted as well illustrating a distinction between official and unofficial acts, giving an example that creating fraudulent electors for certification are not official acts...   \n\nConstitutional law experts overwhelmingly side with Smith. Many reject the claim by Trump's that no president can be prosecuted unless he has been first been impeached, convicted and removed from office, they call that argument \"preposterous.\" \n\nSenate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell had similarly rejected that idea when he voted against conviction in the second Trump impeachment. \"President Trump is still liable for everything he did while he was in office,\" McConnell said in a speech on the Senate floor. \"We have a criminal justice system in this country ... and former presidents are not immune.\"\n\nCan a former president be prosecuted for alleged crimes while in office \\[absent a prior impeachment, conviction and removal\\]?   \n\n[2024-03-19 - US v.

I understand that sometimes the answer is \"we don't know\", which I would prefer as an answer if true instead of speculating.\n\nRFK Jr.\u2019s supporters sometimes claim that he dropped out because of the Democratic Party sabotaging his efforts to run as a Democrat, which I find strange because him \u201cwithdrawing\u201d implies that he did it on his own. Of course, that could also mean he was compelled into doing so without a choice, but I find it strange that they would go after him specifically and not some of the other candidates. Even if something was going on behind the scenes that caused him to withdraw unwillingly, I don\u2019t see how that necessarily translates into corruption; I imagine that the DNC wouldn\u2019t want to support him if they sensed that he wasn\u2019t aligning with their values or for other reasons. I believe RFK Jr. himself claims that the DNC pushed him out, so I\u2019m also wondering if there\u2019s possibly precedent for them doing so (if true), whether or not it was legitimate.\n\nThis topic is separate from the lawsuits against him to get on ballots \u2013 I\u2019m getting mixed information on whether or not those lawsuits are fair or corrupt as well, but that\u2019s a different question (you can discuss that as well if you\u2019d like). I\u2019m just wondering if there\u2019s any justification to the claim that he was pushed out of the race before the primaries by the Democratic Party, whether it was out of corruption or reasonable issues.

Every potential juror likely has some kind of existing notion or view of him, or has heard of potentially prejudicial facts or events relating to him that do not pertain to the particular case. \n\nIt is particularly hard to imagine New Yorkers - where today's trial is being held, and where he has been a fairly prominent part of the city's culture for decades - not being both familiar with and opinionated on Trump. To an extent he is a totally unique case in America, having been a celebrity for decades before being the country's head of state. Even Ronald Reagan didn't have his own TV show. \n\nSo how would you determine whether the jury on one of Trump's trials is truly impartial or not? Can anyone who says they have no prior knowledge or opinion of Trump really be trusted about that? And how far does the law's expectation of neutrality go? Is knowing he was president prejudicial? It's a fact, and probably the most well-known fact about him, but even that could greatly influence one's partiality for or against him.",

Note that cumulative inflation under Reagan was about the same. Details on that below. Now for the positives:\n\nThe current US Misery Index is just a little higher than the modern low seen in September, 2015 and below the average in recent decades. It's also fallen sharply from the pandemic and supply chain crisis highs a few years ago and far lower than it was in 1984.\n\n[https://cdn-0.inflationdata.com/articles/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Misery-Index2-for-Feb-2024.png?ezimgfmt=ng:webp/ngcb1](https://cdn-0.inflationdata.com/articles/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Misery-Index2-for-Feb-2024.png?ezimgfmt=ng:webp/ngcb1)\n\n[Unemployment](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/UNRATE) is very low vs 3 years ago [wage growth has outpaced inflation](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/LES1252881600Q) for well over a year now, settling in above the pre-pandemic high (note the 2020 spike was due to low wage workers temporarily dropping out of the workforce). Over 13 million jobs have been added and more than 5 million above pre-pandemic levels. Moreover, economic conditions have generally exceeded expectations, so far [defying recession predictions](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/23/why-everyone-thinks-a-recession-is-coming-in-2023.html).\n\nIn both presidencies, the situation significantly improved. Inflation by 1984 had dropped close to 4%. 3.2% now. But the prevailing narrative is that prices today are still elevated. If the argument is that people are still dealing with higher prices than 3 years ago (which is countered by rising incomes - real wages are above pre-pandemic levels), why didn't Reagan take the hit? Cumulative inflation during [his first 3 years was about 18%](https://data.bls.gov/cgi-bin/cpicalc.pl), similar to the last 3 years (19%). Both presidents inherited high inflation - Biden the global supply chain crisis that emerged in early 2021.\n\nInterest rates were far higher in 1984 too. Real wages were flat. Unemployment was still considerably higher, 7-8% in 1984. By objective measures, the economic situation today is significantly better than in 1984.\n\nI propose some reasons. What percentages would you assign to these? Feel free to add more.\n\n1. Perceptions are far less influenced by objective reality and more influenced by a media sphere that delivers \"news\" that one wants to hear. Everyone has their own version that confirms one's confirmation biases.\n2. Related to #1, Republicans in particular view the economy through very thick partisan lenses. Very likely, if we had a Republican president with the same economic situation, they'd be shouting it from the rooftops. Instead, the numbers are fake and they're bombarded with negative economic news spin.\n3. Republican propaganda is effective. \"I did that\" stickers on the pump when global oil prices were high. Little positive when they dropped sharply. Media repeats the popular sentiment.\n4. Some Democrats and Independents are less influenced by partisan spin and have a tendency to view the economy through other factors like inequality or having to work paycheck to paycheck. Thus, their views are usually negative. Combined with #2, results in solid net negative approvals for a Democratic president on the economy.\n5. Mainstream press today in general tends to put a negative spin on economic news or highlights the negative aspects. i.e. news of job cuts vs hiring. Focus on cumulative inflation vs the big rate drops, wage increases, and very low unemployment. Consistent stories about the price of groceries now vs lack of similar narrative in 1984.\n6. The timing of inflation leads to more people willing to give Reagan a break, as high inflation preceded his presidency while blaming Biden since it took off early 2021. This implies most of the public is unaware of the global supply chain crisis and the surge in global inflation in recent years.\n7. Cumulative inflation still impacts people. Note I cover that above with Reagan.\n8. The Reagan landslide vs current close race has much to do with current polarization. No one is likely to win by 18% or close to it these days. The polarization is particularly pronounced among Republicans.\n\nOthers?\n\n&#x200B;",

That includes the \u201ccountry isn\u2019t ready\u201d concern, and it would have been an uphill climb to overcome.\n\nFast forward to today, the country had been reluctantly behind Biden. When he dropped out of the race, there was a palpable wave of energy that took the party by storm. People had hope, were inspired, and were excited at the possibilities of what comes next. Kamala entering the race right as this surge of enthusiasm picked up allowed people to look past the hypothetical concerns that plagued her before. Instead of wondering how America would react to a woman president, they were looking into why Democrats seemed to be so excited about her as a candidate. They went into their research with open eyes and a positive attitude, and came out as full blown supporters.\n\nThat\u2019s the root of my question / discussion. We tend to look at Biden holding on to the nomination for as long as he did as damaging, as it left his replacement with only a few months to effectively campaign. But as we look back at that decision in years to come, will it ultimately be seen a good or a bad one? Would Biden deciding not to run and endorsing Kamala from day one have had the same impact as doing so this close to the election?",

The LibDems in Britain don't really try to supply a prime minister. Others form an alliance to collectively propose a prime minister or president.\n\nAmerican third parties have had success at other levels of government and have even had some decent runs in Congress during some periods. In the 55th Congress in 1897 to 1899, there were 12 third party senators out of 90, or 13.3%, and 27 representatives out of 343 or 7.8%, as just one example. They know how to form alliances, The Democratic-Populist-Free Silver ticket has been done before as have Liberal Republicans against Ulysses Grant. The Vermont Progressive Party has a decent sized caucus for a third party with 7 of 150 reps in the lower house in 2022 and has at least one senator and sometimes more than that, and only now that the base is there do they even try to run for governor and other statewide offices. And this is with a system that is just as subject to first past the post and ballot access issues as the US does in general.\n\nThe third parties seem to get campaigns and donations, and then hit themselves with a hammer in a run for the presidency as opposed to doing something even remotely helpful by picking districts and races they could actually win. In the legislature they might be able to pull off actual deals, especially if the majority among the biggest party is small or even cause there to be no parties with an absolute majority of seats, which today, could actually realistically happen if they played their cards right.",

Harris said \"...the climate crisis is real, that it is an urgent matter to which we should apply metrics that include holding ourselves to deadlines around time.

I think a million or so of them are currently working as well?

Why is Texas sending the national guard to the border and getting snippy with the feds when they could just start arresting people who employ the immigrants or the immigrants themselves?",

This court has shown to have more impact on the US than both other two branches of government.  If Trump gets elected, it seems likely that Alito and thomas will resign and be replaced with younger justices.  This will secure a conservative control over the supreme court for at least another 20 or more years.  Seeing as this current court has moved to consolidate power in partisan ways, what could democrats do if Trump gets another term and both Alito and Thomas are replaced?  Can anything significant be done in the next 5-10 following trumps second presidency or will the US government be stuck with this aggressive conservative court for at least 20 more years?",

I brought up the fact that there are other social issues that could be affected, but they called me tone deaf for comparing that to an active genocide. They have no hope for the Democrat party, want the two party system to burn to the ground, and for all of us to collectively suffer. \n\nI believe progress takes time and that the most direct way for us to impact change is to vote. Is it possible to still convince them to vote? Honestly we live in a solidly blue state so it\u2019s not like we won\u2019t end up voting blue anyway. Not sure if this violates any rule but I would like to see more progressive voices in office and to see my friends decide to not vote is frustrating. \n\nEdit: I am not a perfect and moral person. I am just a privileged, regular, uninteresting person of the masses, safely tucked away in a blue bubble. My friends and I can probably survive another four years of red, but I know that many of my peers in battleground/red states would not. Regrettably, harm reduction is the norm of American politics. \n\nWe do not live in a fantasy world where our entire system burns to the ground and my friends and their sympathizers emerge from the flames as rebels to rebuild a new democracy. I don\u2019t believe that is what they truly want. As some have mentioned, my friends are people who have lost (or never had) faith in the system. It has failed and disappointed them, so I don\u2019t blame them for their anger. \n\nI value my friends and I understand their decision to not participate in the two party system. It makes more sense for me to instead seek out those who do not typically vote, and to support campaigns that I am interested in. \n\nI appreciate the many thoughtful responses and thank those who supplied links and articles. Conversation is the way to understanding and I hope people continue to conduct respectful discussions about this topic.",
